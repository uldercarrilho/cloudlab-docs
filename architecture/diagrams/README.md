# Architecture Diagrams

This folder contains visual representations of system architecture, including system overviews, service interactions, and data flows.

## Purpose
Diagrams provide visual documentation to help understand system structure, relationships, and data movement across components.

## Organization
- `system-overview/`: High-level system architecture diagrams
- `service-interactions/`: Service communication and dependency diagrams  
- `data-flow/`: Data movement and processing flow diagrams

## Conventions
- Use consistent notation and symbols
- Include legends for complex diagrams
- Keep diagrams up-to-date with system changes
- Store source files (e.g., .drawio, .puml) alongside exported images
