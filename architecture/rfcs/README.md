# Request for Comments (RFCs)

This folder contains RFC documents for proposing significant changes, new features, or standards that require team discussion and consensus.

## Purpose
RFCs facilitate collaborative decision-making by allowing the team to discuss and refine proposals before implementation.

## Lifecycle
- **Draft**: Initial proposal for discussion
- **Under Review**: Active discussion and feedback
- **Accepted**: Approved for implementation
- **Rejected**: Not approved, with reasons documented
- **Implemented**: Successfully delivered

## Template
Use the PRD + ADR hybrid template in `/templates/prd-adr-template.md` for consistency. This template combines product requirements with architectural decisions, making it ideal for solo development and AI collaboration.
