# ADR-015: Documentation & Knowledge Management Architecture

## Status
**Status**: Draft  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Author**: AI Agent (Ulder Carrilho Júnior oversight)  
**Supersedes**: None

## Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires a comprehensive documentation and knowledge management strategy to ensure effective collaboration, maintainability, and knowledge sharing across the development team. With complex distributed systems architecture, multiple microservices, and evolving requirements, we need a robust documentation platform that enables seamless knowledge capture, maintenance, and accessibility for all team members and future AI agents.

## Problem Statement

Without proper documentation and knowledge management:
- Architectural decisions and rationale are lost over time
- New team members struggle to understand system design and implementation
- Knowledge silos develop, reducing team collaboration effectiveness
- System maintenance becomes difficult without proper documentation
- API documentation becomes outdated, causing integration issues
- Operational procedures are not standardized, leading to inconsistent practices
- Knowledge transfer between team members is inefficient
- Future AI agents cannot effectively understand and extend the system
- Compliance and audit requirements cannot be met without proper documentation

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive documentation and knowledge management strategy using **GitBook** as the primary documentation platform, **GitHub** for ADR management and version control, **OpenAPI/Swagger** for API documentation, **Markdown** for all documentation content, **automated documentation generation** through CI/CD pipelines, and **structured knowledge management processes** for maintaining documentation quality and currency.

## Decision Criteria & Weighting
