# ADR-012: Search & Analytics Architecture

## Status
**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Author**: AI Agent (Ulder Carrilho Júnior oversight)  
**Supersedes**: None  

## Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires a robust search engine and analytics platform to provide fast product search capabilities and comprehensive business insights. With large product catalogs, high query volumes, and the need for real-time analytics, we need to establish search infrastructure, real-time analytics capabilities, and data processing strategies that can handle sub-100ms search response times, real-time business metrics, and scalable data processing while maintaining operational simplicity and cost efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Without proper search and analytics infrastructure:
- Product search performance degrades with catalog growth (>500ms response times)
- Business intelligence lacks real-time insights for decision making
- Data processing cannot handle high-volume streaming data
- Search relevance quality decreases as product catalog expands
- Analytics queries become slow and resource-intensive
- Operational complexity increases with manual search tuning
- Infrastructure costs grow linearly with data volume
- System cannot provide actionable business insights in real-time

## Decision

We will implement a **hybrid search and analytics architecture** using **Elasticsearch** for search engine capabilities, **ClickHouse** for real-time analytics, **Apache Kafka** for data streaming, and **Redis** for caching and session management. This architecture will achieve sub-100ms search response times, provide real-time analytics with sub-second query performance, handle large-scale data processing, and maintain operational simplicity while ensuring cost efficiency and learning value.

**Technology Role Clarification:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Product catalog storage and transactional data (ACID compliance)
- **Elasticsearch**: Product search, user-generated content search, and real-time analytics
- **ClickHouse**: Business intelligence, performance metrics, and long-term analytics
- **Redis**: Search result caching and session data

**Search Architecture Pattern:**
- **Write-Through**: Product updates written to PostgreSQL first, then indexed in Elasticsearch
- **Event-Driven**: Search index updates triggered by product catalog events via Kafka
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis caches frequent search results and user preferences
- **Consistency Model**: Eventual consistency for search (5-minute propagation delay acceptable)

**Data Retention Policies:**
- **Search Data (Elasticsearch)**: 2 years for search analytics, 7 years for audit logs
- **Analytics Data (ClickHouse)**: 2 years for detailed analytics, 7 years for aggregated metrics
- **Cache Data (Redis)**: 24 hours for search results, 7 days for user preferences
- **Business Intelligence**: 2 years for detailed data, 7 years for compliance requirements

## Decision Criteria & Weighting

### Evaluation Criteria (Total Weight: 100%)
- **Performance Impact**: 30% - Search response times, analytics query performance, and scalability
- **Cost Efficiency**: 25% - Infrastructure costs, operational overhead, and ROI
