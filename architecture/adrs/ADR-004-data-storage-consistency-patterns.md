## 2. Summary
> Establish data storage technologies and consistency patterns for the distributed e-commerce platform, defining how data is stored, replicated, and maintained across the system while balancing consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).

**Example:** Implement multi-database architecture with PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for caching, ClickHouse for analytics, and event sourcing for audit trails, ensuring optimal performance and consistency for each data domain.

---

## 3. Problem & Context
> What problem are we solving? What's the current situation?

**Example:** The distributed e-commerce platform needs a robust data architecture that can handle high-volume transactions, provide fast product searches, maintain data consistency across services, and support real-time analytics while ensuring data durability and recovery capabilities.

**Current Situation:**
- No established data storage strategy for the distributed platform
- Need to handle different consistency requirements for different data types
- Must balance performance, scalability, and operational complexity
- Requires understanding of CAP theorem trade-offs for distributed systems
