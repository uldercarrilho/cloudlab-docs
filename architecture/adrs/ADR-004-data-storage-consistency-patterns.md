## 1. Document Info
- **Document Name:** ADR-004: Data Storage & Consistency Patterns
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** 2025-08-12
- **Author:** AI Agent
- **Status:** Approved

## 2. Summary
> Establish data storage technologies and consistency patterns for the distributed e-commerce platform, defining how data is stored, replicated, and maintained across the system while balancing consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).

**Example:** Implement multi-database architecture with PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for caching, ClickHouse for analytics, and event sourcing for audit trails, ensuring optimal performance and consistency for each data domain.

---

## 3. Problem & Context
> What problem are we solving? What's the current situation?

**Example:** The distributed e-commerce platform needs a robust data architecture that can handle high-volume transactions, provide fast product searches, maintain data consistency across services, and support real-time analytics while ensuring data durability and recovery capabilities.

**Current Situation:**
- No established data storage strategy for the distributed platform
- Need to handle different consistency requirements for different data types
- Must balance performance, scalability, and operational complexity
- Requires understanding of CAP theorem trade-offs for distributed systems

## 5. Business Rules & Constraints
> Rules that must always be true, plus any limitations.

**Examples:**

- User sessions can sacrifice consistency for partition tolerance (P from CAP)
- All financial transactions must be auditable and traceable
- Data retention policies must comply with regulatory requirements
- Backup procedures must ensure RPO < 1 hour and RTO < 4 hours

## 7. Architecture Decision Record

### Decision
> What did we choose and why?

**Primary Database (Transactional Data):** PostgreSQL
- **Why:** ACID compliance, mature ecosystem, excellent JSON support, and proven reliability for financial transactions
- **Use Case:** Orders, payments, user accounts, inventory management

**Caching Layer:** Redis
- **Why:** In-memory performance, rich data structures, persistence options, and wide ecosystem support
- **Use Case:** Session management, product catalog cache, API response caching

**Analytics Database:** ClickHouse
- **Why:** Columnar storage optimized for analytical queries, excellent compression, and fast aggregations
- **Use Case:** Business intelligence, user behavior analytics, performance metrics

**Event Store:** PostgreSQL with event sourcing pattern
- **Why:** Leverage existing PostgreSQL infrastructure, ACID compliance for event ordering, and familiar tooling
- **Use Case:** Audit trails, data lineage, CQRS read models

### Alternatives Considered

#### Relational Databases
- **MySQL:** Good performance but weaker JSON support and less mature ecosystem for distributed systems
- **CockroachDB:** Excellent distributed capabilities but higher operational complexity and newer technology
- **PostgreSQL:** Best balance of features, maturity, and ecosystem support

#### Caching Solutions
- **Memcached:** Simple but lacks persistence and rich data structures
- **Hazelcast:** Enterprise-grade but higher complexity and licensing costs
- **Redis:** Optimal balance of performance, features, and operational simplicity

#### Analytics Databases
- **InfluxDB:** Time-series optimized but limited for general analytics
- **TimescaleDB:** PostgreSQL extension but less specialized for analytical workloads
- **ClickHouse:** Purpose-built for analytics with excellent performance characteristics

### Consequences
- ✅ **PostgreSQL:** Proven reliability, rich ecosystem, ACID compliance
- ✅ **Redis:** High performance, rich data structures, persistence options
- ✅ **ClickHouse:** Excellent analytical performance, efficient storage
- ✅ **Event Sourcing:** Complete audit trail, temporal queries, CQRS support
- ❌ **Operational Complexity:** Managing multiple database technologies
- ❌ **Data Synchronization:** Keeping data consistent across different stores
- ❌ **Learning Curve:** Team needs to understand multiple technologies

## 9. AI Collaboration Notes
> Specific guidance for AI assistant collaboration.

**Examples:**
- Focus on practical implementation patterns rather than theoretical concepts
- Consider operational complexity and team skill levels
- Ensure all decisions are backed by performance data and benchmarks
- Document trade-offs clearly for future decision-making
- Include code examples and configuration snippets where helpful
- Consider migration strategies from existing systems
