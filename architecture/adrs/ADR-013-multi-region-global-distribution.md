## Status
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-14
**Author**: AI Agent (Ulder Carrilho Júnior oversight)  
**Supersedes**: None  

## Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires a multi-region deployment strategy to serve customers globally with low latency, ensure data compliance with regional regulations, and provide disaster recovery capabilities. With customers across multiple continents, varying compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), and the need for sub-200ms response times globally, we need to establish a comprehensive multi-region architecture that balances performance, compliance, cost, and operational complexity while maintaining data consistency and business continuity.

## Problem Statement

Without proper multi-region deployment:
- Global customers experience high latency (>500ms) affecting user experience and conversion rates
- Regional compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, data residency) cannot be met
- Single-region deployment creates a single point of failure for business operations
- Data sovereignty requirements cannot be satisfied for international customers
- Disaster recovery capabilities are limited to single-region backups
- Cross-region data synchronization and consistency are not managed
- Infrastructure costs are not optimized for regional usage patterns
- Business continuity is at risk during regional outages

## Decision

We will implement a **hybrid multi-region architecture** using **active-active deployment** for primary regions (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific) with **active-passive** for secondary regions, **regional data residency** for compliance, **cross-region data synchronization** for critical business data, and **global load balancing** with intelligent routing. This architecture will achieve sub-200ms response times globally, ensure compliance with regional regulations, provide 99.9% availability, and maintain cost efficiency while enabling learning of global-scale distributed systems.

**Business Rule Considerations:**
- **Regional Compliance**: GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), LGPD (Brazil) compliance per region
- **Data Residency**: User data stored in user's region, vendor data in vendor's region
- **Tax Compliance**: Regional tax rates and calculation rules applied per region
- **Content Moderation**: Regional content standards and moderation rules
- **Payment Processing**: Regional payment methods and compliance requirements
- **Shipping Rules**: Regional shipping costs, delivery times, and restrictions

## Decision Criteria & Weighting

### Evaluation Criteria (Total Weight: 100%)
- **Performance & Latency**: 25% - Global response times, regional performance, and user experience
- **Compliance & Data Residency**: 25% - Regional compliance, data sovereignty, and regulatory requirements
- **Availability & Disaster Recovery**: 20% - Uptime, failover capabilities, and business continuity
- **Cost Efficiency**: 15% - Infrastructure costs, operational overhead, and ROI
- **Operational Complexity**: 10% - Setup, maintenance, and team expertise required
- **Learning Value**: 5% - Educational benefits and skill development

- **Compliance**: Cannot meet regional data residency and compliance requirements
- **Availability**: Single point of failure with limited disaster recovery
- **Learning Value**: Minimal exposure to multi-region architecture concepts

**Decision**: Rejected due to poor global performance, compliance limitations, and minimal learning value. While cost-effective, it doesn't meet our performance and compliance requirements.
