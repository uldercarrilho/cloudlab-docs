# ADR-013: Multi-Region & Global Distribution Architecture

## Status
**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Author**: AI Agent (Ulder Carrilho Júnior oversight)  
**Supersedes**: None  

## Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires a multi-region deployment strategy to serve customers globally with low latency, ensure data compliance with regional regulations, and provide disaster recovery capabilities. With customers across multiple continents, varying compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), and the need for sub-200ms response times globally, we need to establish a comprehensive multi-region architecture that balances performance, compliance, cost, and operational complexity while maintaining data consistency and business continuity.

## Problem Statement

Without proper multi-region deployment:
- Global customers experience high latency (>500ms) affecting user experience and conversion rates
- Regional compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, data residency) cannot be met
- Single-region deployment creates a single point of failure for business operations
- Data sovereignty requirements cannot be satisfied for international customers
- Disaster recovery capabilities are limited to single-region backups
- Cross-region data synchronization and consistency are not managed
- Infrastructure costs are not optimized for regional usage patterns
- Business continuity is at risk during regional outages

## Decision

We will implement a **hybrid multi-region architecture** using **active-active deployment** for primary regions (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific) with **active-passive** for secondary regions, **regional data residency** for compliance, **cross-region data synchronization** for critical business data, and **global load balancing** with intelligent routing. This architecture will achieve sub-200ms response times globally, ensure compliance with regional regulations, provide 99.9% availability, and maintain cost efficiency while enabling learning of global-scale distributed systems.

## Decision Criteria & Weighting

### Evaluation Criteria (Total Weight: 100%)
- **Performance & Latency**: 25% - Global response times, regional performance, and user experience
- **Compliance & Data Residency**: 25% - Regional compliance, data sovereignty, and regulatory requirements
- **Availability & Disaster Recovery**: 20% - Uptime, failover capabilities, and business continuity
- **Cost Efficiency**: 15% - Infrastructure costs, operational overhead, and ROI
- **Operational Complexity**: 10% - Setup, maintenance, and team expertise required
- **Learning Value**: 5% - Educational benefits and skill development

| Single Region + CDN | 5/10 | 6/10 | 5/10 | 9/10 | 9/10 | 6/10 | 6.4/10 | ❌ Rejected |

#### Hybrid Active-Active + Passive ✅ **Selected**
**Description**: Primary regions (NA, EU, APAC) operate in active-active mode with full functionality, while secondary regions operate in active-passive mode for disaster recovery and compliance.

**Pros**:
- **Performance**: Excellent global performance with sub-200ms response times across primary regions
- **Compliance**: Full regional compliance with data residency and sovereignty requirements
- **Availability**: High availability (99.9%) with automatic failover between regions
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across regions with load distribution
- **Learning Value**: Comprehensive exposure to multi-region architecture patterns
- **Flexibility**: Can adapt regions based on business needs and compliance requirements

**Cons**:
- **Cost**: Higher infrastructure costs compared to simpler deployments
- **Complexity**: Requires sophisticated cross-region synchronization and failover logic
- **Operational Overhead**: More complex monitoring, deployment, and maintenance procedures

**Decision**: Selected for its excellent balance of performance, compliance, and availability. The hybrid approach provides optimal user experience while maintaining cost efficiency and enabling comprehensive learning.

#### Global Active-Active ❌ **Rejected**
**Description**: All regions operate in active-active mode with full functionality and data replication across all regions.

**Pros**:
- **Performance**: Maximum performance and availability across all regions
- **Scalability**: Full horizontal scaling with load distribution everywhere
- **Resilience**: Maximum redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities

**Cons**:
- **Cost**: Extremely high infrastructure costs with full replication across all regions
- **Complexity**: Highest operational complexity with cross-region data consistency challenges
- **Compliance**: Potential compliance issues with data replication across regions
- **Operational Overhead**: Requires extensive expertise and sophisticated tooling

**Decision**: Rejected due to excessive costs and complexity. While providing maximum performance, the cost-benefit ratio is not justified for our learning objectives and business requirements.

#### Regional Active-Passive ❌ **Rejected**
**Description**: Single active region with passive regions for disaster recovery and compliance, minimal cross-region functionality.

**Pros**:
- **Cost**: Lower infrastructure costs with minimal cross-region resources
- **Simplicity**: Simpler operational model with clear primary/secondary roles
- **Compliance**: Basic compliance with data residency requirements

**Cons**:
- **Performance**: Limited global performance with single active region
- **Availability**: Lower availability with longer failover times
- **User Experience**: Poor experience for users outside the active region
- **Learning Value**: Limited exposure to active-active multi-region patterns

**Decision**: Rejected due to poor global performance and limited learning value. The cost savings don't justify the performance and availability trade-offs.

#### Single Region + CDN ❌ **Rejected**
**Description**: Single region deployment with global CDN for static content delivery, minimal regional infrastructure.

**Pros**:
- **Cost**: Lowest infrastructure costs with minimal regional resources
- **Simplicity**: Simplest operational model with single region management
- **Static Performance**: Good performance for static content via CDN

**Cons**:
- **Performance**: Poor performance for dynamic content and API calls globally
- **Compliance**: Cannot meet regional data residency and compliance requirements
- **Availability**: Single point of failure with limited disaster recovery
- **Learning Value**: Minimal exposure to multi-region architecture concepts

**Decision**: Rejected due to poor global performance, compliance limitations, and minimal learning value. While cost-effective, it doesn't meet our performance and compliance requirements.
