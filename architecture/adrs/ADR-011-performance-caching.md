## Status
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-13
**Author**: AI Agent (Ulder Carrilho Júnior oversight)  
**Supersedes**: None  

## Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires high-performance caching strategies to achieve sub-200ms response times for 95th percentile of requests and handle 10x traffic spikes during sales events. With multiple microservices, distributed data storage, and global user base, we need a comprehensive multi-level caching approach that provides optimal performance, cost efficiency, and operational simplicity while maintaining data consistency and user experience quality.

## Problem Statement

Without proper performance optimization and caching:
- User experience suffers from slow response times (>500ms)
- System cannot handle traffic spikes during sales events
- Database becomes a bottleneck under high load
- CDN costs escalate without proper optimization
- Cache invalidation complexity leads to stale data
- Performance monitoring lacks actionable insights
- Infrastructure costs grow linearly with traffic
- System reliability degrades under stress

## Decision

We will implement a **multi-level caching architecture** using **Redis Cluster** for application-level caching, **CloudFlare CDN** for global content delivery, **application-level caching patterns** (Cache-Aside, Write-Through, Write-Behind), and **comprehensive performance monitoring** with distributed tracing. This architecture will achieve sub-200ms response times, handle 10x traffic spikes, maintain >95% cache hit rates, and provide cost-effective performance optimization while ensuring data consistency and operational simplicity.

    // Try cache first
    cacheKey := fmt.Sprintf("product:%s", productID)
    if cached, err := redis.Get(cacheKey); err == nil {
        var product Product
        if json.Unmarshal([]byte(cached), &product) == nil {
            return &product, nil
        }
    }
    
    // Cache miss - fetch from database
    product, err := db.GetProduct(productID)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    // Update cache
    if data, err := json.Marshal(product); err == nil {

    }
    
    return product, nil
}
```

    // Synchronously update cache
    cacheKey := fmt.Sprintf("product:%s", productID)
    if data, err := json.Marshal(product); err == nil {
        // This synchronous write can impact performance
        err = redis.SetEx(cacheKey, string(data), 3600)
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("Cache update failed for product %s: %v", productID, err)

    product, err := db.GetProduct(productID)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    
    // Apply updates to product

    ttl, err := redis.TTL(cacheKey)
    if err != nil {
        return false
    }
    
    // Refresh if TTL is less than 10% of original TTL
    return ttl < 360 // 10% of 1 hour (3600 seconds)
}

func refreshCacheAhead(productID, cacheKey string) {
    // Fetch fresh data from database
    product, err := db.GetProduct(productID)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Refresh-ahead failed for product %s: %v", productID, err)
        return
    }
    
    // Update cache with fresh data
    if data, err := json.Marshal(product); err == nil {
        redis.SetEx(cacheKey, string(data), 3600)
        log.Printf("Cache refreshed ahead for product %s", productID)
