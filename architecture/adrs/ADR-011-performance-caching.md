**Status**: Draft  
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Author**: AI Agent (Ulder Carrilho Júnior oversight)  
**Supersedes**: None  

## Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires high-performance caching strategies to achieve sub-200ms response times for 95th percentile of requests and handle 10x traffic spikes during sales events. With multiple microservices, distributed data storage, and global user base, we need a comprehensive multi-level caching approach that provides optimal performance, cost efficiency, and operational simplicity while maintaining data consistency and user experience quality.

## Problem Statement

Without proper performance optimization and caching:
- User experience suffers from slow response times (>500ms)
- System cannot handle traffic spikes during sales events
- Database becomes a bottleneck under high load
- CDN costs escalate without proper optimization
- Cache invalidation complexity leads to stale data
- Performance monitoring lacks actionable insights
- Infrastructure costs grow linearly with traffic
- System reliability degrades under stress

## Decision

We will implement a **multi-level caching architecture** using **Redis Cluster** for application-level caching, **CloudFlare CDN** for global content delivery, **application-level caching patterns** (Cache-Aside, Write-Through, Write-Behind), and **comprehensive performance monitoring** with distributed tracing. This architecture will achieve sub-200ms response times, handle 10x traffic spikes, maintain >95% cache hit rates, and provide cost-effective performance optimization while ensuring data consistency and operational simplicity.
