# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records that document significant architectural decisions made for the system.

## Purpose
ADRs capture the context, options considered, and consequences of important architectural decisions to help future developers understand why certain choices were made.

## Process
- Each ADR follows the standard template format
- ADRs are numbered sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
- Once accepted, ADRs are immutable
- Superseded decisions are marked but not deleted

## Current ADRs
- **ADR-001**: User Management & Authentication
- **ADR-002**: Order Processing & Fulfillment
- **ADR-003**: Container Orchestration & Service Mesh
- **ADR-004**: Data Storage & Consistency Patterns
- **ADR-005**: Message Queue & Event Streaming
- **ADR-006**: API Communication Patterns
- **ADR-007**: Cloud Infrastructure
- **ADR-008**: Monitoring & Observability
- **ADR-009**: Security & Authentication
- **ADR-010**: CI/CD Deployment
- **ADR-011**: Performance & Caching
- **ADR-012**: Search & Analytics
- **ADR-013**: Multi-Region Global Distribution
- **ADR-014**: Testing & Quality Assurance
- **ADR-015**: Compliance & Regulatory Requirements
- **ADR-016**: Documentation & Knowledge Management
- **ADR-017**: Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery
- **ADR-018**: Vendor Management Architecture
- **ADR-019**: Content Management & Moderation
- **ADR-020**: Payment Processing Architecture
- **ADR-021**: Social Features & Content Moderation
- **ADR-022**: Shipping & Logistics Integration
- **ADR-023**: Service Mesh Security Patterns
- **ADR-024**: Distributed Tracing Strategy

## Template
Use the PRD + ADR hybrid template in `/templates/prd-adr-template.md` for consistency. This template combines product requirements with architectural decisions, making it ideal for solo development and AI collaboration.
