# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records that document significant architectural decisions made for the system.

## Purpose
ADRs capture the context, options considered, and consequences of important architectural decisions to help future developers understand why certain choices were made.

## Process
- Each ADR follows the standard template format
- ADRs are numbered sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
- Once accepted, ADRs are immutable
- Superseded decisions are marked but not deleted

## Current ADRs
- **ADR-003**: Container Orchestration & Service Mesh
- **ADR-004**: Data Storage & Consistency Patterns
- **ADR-005**: Message Queue & Event Streaming
- **ADR-006**: API Communication Patterns
- **ADR-007**: Cloud Infrastructure

## Template
Use the PRD + ADR hybrid template in `/templates/prd-adr-template.md` for consistency. This template combines product requirements with architectural decisions, making it ideal for solo development and AI collaboration.
