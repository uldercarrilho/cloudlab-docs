# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records that document significant architectural decisions made for the system.

## Purpose
ADRs capture the context, options considered, and consequences of important architectural decisions to help future developers understand why certain choices were made.

## Process
- Each ADR follows the standard template format
- ADRs are numbered sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
- Once accepted, ADRs are immutable
- Superseded decisions are marked but not deleted

## Template
Use the ADR template in `/templates/adr-template.md` for consistency.
