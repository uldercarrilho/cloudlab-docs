## Status
**Status**: Draft  
**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Author**: AI Agent (Ulder Carrilho Júnior oversight)  
**Supersedes**: None  

## Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires a robust CI/CD pipeline and deployment strategy to ensure rapid, reliable, and safe delivery of software changes. With multiple microservices, complex dependencies, and strict uptime requirements (99.9%), we need an automated deployment pipeline that supports zero-downtime deployments, comprehensive testing, feature flags, and rapid rollback capabilities while maintaining operational excellence and team productivity.

## Problem Statement

Without proper CI/CD and deployment automation:
- Manual deployments introduce human errors and inconsistencies
- Long deployment cycles slow down development velocity
- Lack of automated testing increases production risk
- No rollback strategy leads to extended downtime during failures
- Feature releases cannot be controlled or gradually rolled out
- Infrastructure deployment is manual and error-prone
- Compliance and audit requirements cannot be met consistently
- Team productivity is reduced by operational overhead

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive CI/CD architecture using **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD orchestration, **Blue-Green deployment** for zero-downtime releases, **LaunchDarkly** for feature flag management, **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code, and **ArgoCD** for GitOps-based deployment management. This architecture will ensure automated testing, safe deployments, rapid rollbacks, and operational excellence while maintaining high development velocity and system reliability.

## Learning and Practice Opportunities

### Deployment Strategy Practice Scenarios

#### 1. Blue-Green Deployment Practice
- **Scenario**: Deploy a new version of the user authentication service
- **Learning Goals**: 
  - Understand zero-downtime deployment patterns
  - Practice instant rollback procedures
  - Learn health check implementation
- **Practice Steps**:
  1. Deploy new version alongside existing version
  2. Run comprehensive health checks
  3. Switch traffic when ready
  4. Practice rollback on simulated failure

#### 2. Canary Deployment Practice
- **Scenario**: Deploy a new payment processing algorithm
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Understand gradual rollout patterns
  - Practice traffic management and monitoring
  - Learn error rate monitoring and thresholds
- **Practice Steps**:
  1. Deploy to 5% of users initially
  2. Monitor error rates and performance
  3. Gradually increase traffic based on metrics
  4. Practice rollback on threshold violations

#### 3. Rolling Deployment Practice
- **Scenario**: Update the product catalog service
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Understand incremental update patterns
  - Practice resource management
  - Learn health check timeouts and intervals
- **Practice Steps**:
  1. Update one pod at a time
  2. Monitor health checks between updates
  3. Practice handling failed updates
  4. Learn resource efficiency patterns

#### 4. A/B Testing Deployment Practice
- **Scenario**: Test new checkout flow design
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Understand traffic splitting patterns
  - Practice metrics collection and analysis
  - Learn user experience validation
- **Practice Steps**:
  1. Deploy both versions simultaneously
  2. Split traffic 50/50
  3. Collect user experience metrics
  4. Analyze results and make decisions

#### 5. Feature Flag Deployment Practice
- **Scenario**: Roll out new search algorithm
- **Learning Goals**:
  - Understand feature flag patterns
  - Practice user targeting and segmentation
  - Learn instant feature control
- **Practice Steps**:
  1. Deploy with feature flag disabled
  2. Enable for specific user segments
  3. Monitor performance and user feedback
  4. Practice instant rollback via flags

### Practice Environment Setup

#### Development Environment
```bash
# Set up local Kubernetes cluster
kind create cluster --name deployment-practice

# Install ArgoCD
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

# Install Istio for traffic management
istioctl install --set profile=demo -y

# Deploy sample applications
kubectl apply -f k8s/sample-apps/
```

#### Practice Workflow
1. **Choose Strategy**: Select deployment strategy for current practice session
2. **Configure Parameters**: Set strategy-specific configuration
3. **Execute Deployment**: Run deployment with selected strategy
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch deployment progress and metrics
5. **Practice Rollback**: Intentionally trigger rollback scenarios
6. **Analyze Results**: Review deployment metrics and learnings
7. **Document Learnings**: Record insights and best practices

### Metrics and Monitoring for Learning

#### Deployment Success Metrics
- **Deployment Time**: Time from start to completion
- **Rollback Frequency**: How often rollbacks occur
- **Error Rates**: Error rates during deployment
- **User Impact**: User experience during deployment
