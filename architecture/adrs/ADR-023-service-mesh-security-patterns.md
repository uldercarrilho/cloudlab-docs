## 2. Summary

Implement advanced Istio service mesh security patterns for the distributed e-commerce platform, including mutual TLS (mTLS), authorization policies, security best practices, and distributed security enforcement across all microservices while maintaining performance and operational simplicity.

---

## 3. Problem & Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires enterprise-grade security enforcement at the service mesh level to protect inter-service communication, enforce access controls, and maintain security compliance across all microservices. While basic Istio security is covered in ADR-003, advanced security patterns are needed for comprehensive distributed systems security learning.

**Current Situation:**
- Basic Istio service mesh implemented (ADR-003)
- Basic mTLS and authorization policies configured
- Missing advanced security patterns and best practices
- No comprehensive security policy management
- Limited security monitoring and alerting

**Challenges:**
- Enforce security policies consistently across all services
- Implement advanced authorization patterns (RBAC, ABAC)
- Secure service-to-service communication with mTLS
- Monitor and audit security policy compliance
- Handle security policy updates and rollbacks
- Integrate with existing security infrastructure (ADR-009)
