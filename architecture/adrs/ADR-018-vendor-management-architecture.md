## 7. Architecture Decision Record

### Decision

**Multi-tenant vendor management architecture** using **dedicated vendor service**, **event-driven commission processing**, **secure multi-tenancy patterns**, and **integrated financial processing** has been selected for the following reasons:

1. **Dedicated Service**: Isolated vendor management with clear boundaries and responsibilities
2. **Event-Driven**: Real-time commission updates and payout processing via Kafka events
3. **Multi-Tenancy**: Secure data isolation using tenant-scoped databases and APIs
4. **Financial Integration**: Direct integration with payment services for vendor payouts
5. **Compliance**: Built-in compliance features for tax reporting and audit trails
6. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for vendor growth and performance requirements

### Decision Matrix with Weighted Criteria

| Criteria | Weight | Dedicated Service | Shared Service | Third-Party Platform |
|----------|--------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Security & Isolation** | 25% | 9/10 | 6/10 | 7/10 |
| **Performance & Scalability** | 20% | 8/10 | 7/10 | 6/10 |

- **Pros**: Rapid implementation, proven compliance, reduced development effort
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, data sovereignty concerns, limited customization, high costs
- **Decision**: Rejected due to vendor lock-in and learning value concerns

#### Alternative 3: Dedicated Vendor Service (Selected)
- **Description**: Build dedicated vendor management microservice with event-driven architecture
- **Pros**: Full control, security isolation, scalability, compliance, learning value
- **Cons**: Development complexity, operational overhead, longer implementation time
- **Decision**: Selected for optimal balance of security, compliance, and learning value
