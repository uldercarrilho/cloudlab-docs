## Status
**Status**: Approved  
**Date**: 2025-08-13
**Author**: AI Agent (Ulder Carrilho Júnior oversight)  
**Supersedes**: None  

## Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires enterprise-grade security and authentication to protect user data, ensure payment security, and maintain compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR requirements. With multiple microservices, multi-tenant architecture, and distributed data storage, we need a robust security framework that provides secure authentication, fine-grained authorization, secure secret management, and comprehensive encryption while maintaining performance and operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Without proper security and authentication:
- User credentials and personal data are vulnerable to breaches
- Payment information is not PCI DSS compliant
- Multi-tenant data isolation cannot be guaranteed
- API endpoints are vulnerable to abuse and attacks
- Compliance requirements cannot be met
- System security is reactive rather than proactive
- Key management and secret rotation become operational nightmares

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive security architecture using **OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect** for authentication, **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for authorization, **HashiCorp Vault** for secret management, **TLS 1.3 + AES-256** for encryption, and **multi-tenant security isolation** with comprehensive API security patterns. This architecture will ensure PCI DSS compliance, GDPR adherence, and enterprise-grade security while maintaining performance and operational efficiency.
