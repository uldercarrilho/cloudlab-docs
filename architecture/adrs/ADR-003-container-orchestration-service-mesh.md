## 2. Summary
> Implement Kubernetes as the container orchestration platform with Istio service mesh to establish a robust, scalable foundation for the distributed e-commerce platform's microservice architecture.

**Example:** Deploy and manage containerized microservices using Kubernetes orchestration with Istio service mesh for advanced traffic management, security, and observability.

---

## 3. Problem & Context
> What problem are we solving? What's the current situation?

**Current Situation:** The distributed e-commerce platform requires a container orchestration solution to manage hundreds of microservices across multiple environments (development, staging, production). We need to handle service discovery, load balancing, scaling, and advanced networking patterns like circuit breakers and retry logic.

**Problems to Solve:**
- Manual container deployment and scaling is not sustainable
- Service-to-service communication needs advanced traffic management
- Security policies must be enforced consistently across services
- Observability and monitoring require centralized control
- Multi-cluster deployment strategy for high availability

---

### 4.1 Functional Requirements
- [x] FR1: Automatically deploy and scale microservices based on demand
- [x] FR2: Provide service discovery and load balancing
- [x] FR3: Implement advanced traffic management (canary deployments, A/B testing)
- [x] FR4: Enforce security policies and mTLS between services
- [x] FR5: Support multi-cluster deployment across regions
- [x] FR6: Provide centralized observability and monitoring

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] NFR1: Handle 10x traffic spikes during sales events

## 7. Architecture Decision Record

### Decision
> What did we choose and why?

**Container Orchestration Platform: Kubernetes**
- **Why Kubernetes:** Industry standard with largest ecosystem, extensive documentation, and community support
- **Managed Service:** Use EKS (AWS) or GKE (GCP) to reduce operational overhead
- **Learning Investment:** Acceptable learning curve given long-term benefits and market demand

**Service Mesh: Istio**
- **Why Istio:** Most feature-rich service mesh with excellent integration with Kubernetes
- **Traffic Management:** Advanced patterns like canary deployments, circuit breakers, and retry logic
- **Security:** Built-in mTLS, authorization policies, and security best practices
- **Observability:** Comprehensive metrics, logs, and tracing out of the box

### Alternatives Considered

#### Container Orchestration Alternatives:
1. **Docker Swarm**
   - ✅ Simpler to learn and operate
   - ❌ Limited ecosystem and community support
   - ❌ Less mature scaling and advanced features
   - ❌ Limited enterprise adoption

2. **HashiCorp Nomad**
   - ✅ Simple and lightweight
   - ✅ Good for mixed workloads (containers, VMs, applications)
   - ❌ Smaller ecosystem compared to Kubernetes
   - ❌ Less mature for complex microservice patterns

3. **Apache Mesos + Marathon**
   - ✅ Proven at scale (Twitter, Uber)
   - ❌ Complex architecture and operation
   - ❌ Declining community and adoption
   - ❌ Steep learning curve

#### Service Mesh Alternatives:
1. **Linkerd**
   - ✅ Lightweight and fast
   - ✅ Simpler to operate than Istio
   - ❌ Fewer advanced features
   - ❌ Smaller ecosystem and community

2. **Consul Connect**
   - ✅ Good integration with HashiCorp stack
   - ✅ Service discovery and configuration management
   - ❌ Less mature service mesh features
   - ❌ Limited traffic management capabilities

3. **AWS App Mesh**
   - ✅ Native AWS integration
   - ✅ Managed service (no operational overhead)
   - ❌ Vendor lock-in to AWS
   - ❌ Less feature-rich than Istio
