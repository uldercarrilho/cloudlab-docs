## Status
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-14
**Author**: AI Agent (Ulder Carrilho Júnior oversight)  
**Supersedes**: None  

## Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires a robust CI/CD pipeline and deployment strategy to ensure rapid, reliable, and safe delivery of software changes. With multiple microservices, complex dependencies, and strict uptime requirements (99.9%), we need an automated deployment pipeline that supports zero-downtime deployments, comprehensive testing, feature flags, and rapid rollback capabilities while maintaining operational excellence and team productivity.

## Problem Statement

Without proper CI/CD and deployment automation:
- Manual deployments introduce human errors and inconsistencies
- Long deployment cycles slow down development velocity
- Lack of automated testing increases production risk
- No rollback strategy leads to extended downtime during failures
- Feature releases cannot be controlled or gradually rolled out
- Infrastructure deployment is manual and error-prone
- Compliance and audit requirements cannot be met consistently
- Team productivity is reduced by operational overhead

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive CI/CD architecture using **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD orchestration, **Blue-Green deployment** for zero-downtime releases, **LaunchDarkly** for feature flag management, **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code, and **ArgoCD** for GitOps-based deployment management. This architecture will ensure automated testing, safe deployments, rapid rollbacks, and operational excellence while maintaining high development velocity and system reliability.
