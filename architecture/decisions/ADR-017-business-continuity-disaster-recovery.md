**Status**: Approved  
**Date**: 2025-08-14  
**Author**: AI Agent
**Supersedes**: None  

## 1. Summary

Implement comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery strategies for the distributed e-commerce platform, ensuring 99.9% uptime during failures and rapid recovery from disaster scenarios while maintaining data integrity and business operations.

## 2. Problem & Context

The distributed e-commerce platform must maintain continuous business operations even during infrastructure failures, natural disasters, or cyber-attacks. Without proper business continuity and disaster recovery strategies, the system risks:

- Extended downtime leading to revenue loss
- Data loss during disaster scenarios
- Inability to serve customers during critical periods
- Regulatory non-compliance for business continuity
- Loss of customer trust and market reputation

The current system lacks comprehensive disaster recovery mechanisms, failover strategies, and business continuity procedures.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
- [ ] FR1: Automatic failover to secondary regions during primary region failures
- [ ] FR2: Data backup and recovery procedures for all critical data
- [ ] FR3: Incident response and escalation procedures
- [ ] FR4: Business continuity testing and validation mechanisms
- [ ] FR5: Multi-region data synchronization and consistency

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] NFR1: Recovery Time Objective (RTO) < 15 minutes for critical services
- [ ] NFR2: Recovery Point Objective (RPO) < 5 minutes for transaction data
- [ ] NFR3: 99.9% uptime during planned maintenance and failures
- [ ] NFR4: Geographic redundancy across at least 3 regions
- [ ] NFR5: Automated disaster recovery testing every 30 days

## 4. Business Rules & Constraints

- **RTO Requirements**: Critical services must recover within 15 minutes, non-critical within 2 hours
- **RPO Requirements**: Transaction data loss must not exceed 5 minutes, user data loss must not exceed 1 hour
- **Geographic Distribution**: Primary and secondary regions must be in different geographic areas
- **Data Consistency**: All critical data must maintain consistency across regions
- **Cost Constraints**: Disaster recovery infrastructure must not exceed 20% of total infrastructure costs

## 6. Architecture Decision Record

### Decision

Implement a **Multi-Region Active-Active with Automated Failover** disaster recovery strategy using the following components:

1. **Primary Strategy**: Active-active multi-region deployment with real-time data synchronization
2. **Failover Mechanism**: Automated health checks with intelligent traffic routing
3. **Data Protection**: Continuous backup with point-in-time recovery capabilities
4. **Recovery Orchestration**: Infrastructure-as-code based recovery procedures
5. **Testing Framework**: Automated disaster recovery testing and validation

### Rationale

This approach provides the best balance of:
- **RTO**: Sub-15 minute recovery for critical services
- **RPO**: Near-zero data loss with continuous synchronization
- **Cost Efficiency**: Leverages existing multi-region infrastructure
- **Operational Simplicity**: Automated failover reduces human error
- **Scalability**: Active-active design supports business growth

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Active-Passive with Manual Failover
- **Pros**: Lower infrastructure costs, simpler architecture
- **Cons**: Longer RTO (30+ minutes), manual intervention required, higher risk of human error
- **Decision**: Rejected due to RTO requirements and operational complexity

#### Alternative 2: Backup and Restore Only
- **Pros**: Minimal infrastructure costs, simple implementation
- **Cons**: Extended RTO (2+ hours), potential data loss, manual recovery process
- **Decision**: Rejected due to business continuity requirements

#### Alternative 3: Multi-Region with Leader-Follower
- **Pros**: Good consistency guarantees, predictable failover behavior
- **Cons**: Higher latency for writes, complex leader election, potential split-brain scenarios
- **Decision**: Rejected due to performance requirements and operational complexity

### Consequences

#### Positive Consequences
- ✅ **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime during failures and maintenance
- ✅ **Fast Recovery**: Sub-15 minute RTO for critical services
- ✅ **Data Protection**: Near-zero RPO with continuous synchronization
- ✅ **Automated Operations**: Reduced human error and faster response times
- ✅ **Scalability**: Active-active design supports business growth

#### Negative Consequences
- ❌ **Higher Costs**: Additional infrastructure for active-active deployment
- ❌ **Complexity**: More complex data synchronization and consistency management
- ❌ **Operational Overhead**: Requires skilled DevOps team for management
- ❌ **Testing Complexity**: More complex disaster recovery testing procedures
