## 2. Summary

Implement a comprehensive user management and authentication architecture for the distributed e-commerce platform by deploying a secure authentication system using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, supporting multi-tenant user management, secure user registration, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control for customers, vendors, and administrators, while ensuring profile management and compliance with security standards and business rules.

---

## 3. Problem & Context
> What problem are we solving? What's the current situation?

**Current Situation:** The distributed e-commerce platform requires a robust user management system that can handle multiple user types (customers, vendors, admins, support), provide secure authentication, and enforce business rules for user registration, verification, and access control.

**Problems to Solve:**
- Need centralized user management across multiple microservices
- Must support different user types with varying permissions
- Authentication must be secure and compliant with PCI DSS and GDPR
- User registration workflows differ by user type (customer vs vendor)
- Multi-tenant isolation must be enforced at the user level
- Session management and security policies must be consistent

## 5. Business Rules & Constraints
> Rules that must always be true, plus any limitations.

**Business Rules (from BUSINESS-RULES-001-ecommerce-platform.md):**
- **Customer Registration**: Email must be unique, password complexity requirements, email verification required

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens expire after 24 hours, refresh tokens valid for 30 days, maximum 5 concurrent sessions
- **MFA**: Required for vendors and admin accounts, optional for customers
- **Session Management**: Automatic logout after 30 minutes of inactivity

## 7. Architecture Decision Record

### Decision
> What did we choose and why?

**Authentication Protocol: OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect**
- **Why:** Industry standard with excellent security, broad ecosystem support, and built-in compliance features
- **Implementation:** Custom OAuth provider using Go with JWT tokens
- **Integration:** Leverages existing security architecture from ADR-009

**User Management Architecture: Centralized User Service**
- **Why:** Single source of truth for user data, consistent business rule enforcement, easier compliance management
- **Pattern:** User service as central authority with event-driven updates to other services
- **Data Model:** Normalized user data with tenant isolation at the database level

**Multi-Factor Authentication: TOTP-based 2FA**
- **Why:** Industry standard, works offline, integrates with authenticator apps, no SMS costs
- **Implementation:** Time-based one-time password using RFC 6238 standard
- **Fallback:** SMS-based 2FA for users without authenticator apps

**Session Management: JWT with Redis Backend**
- **Why:** Stateless JWT for performance, Redis for session revocation and management
- **Token Lifecycle:** 24-hour access tokens, 30-day refresh tokens, automatic rotation
- **Security:** Secure token storage, automatic logout, concurrent session limits
