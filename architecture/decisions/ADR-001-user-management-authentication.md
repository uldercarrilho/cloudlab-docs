## 3. Problem & Context
> What problem are we solving? What's the current situation?

**Current Situation:** The distributed e-commerce platform requires a robust user management system that can handle multiple user types (customers, vendors, admins, support), provide secure authentication, and enforce business rules for user registration, verification, and access control.

**Problems to Solve:**
- Need centralized user management across multiple microservices
- Must support different user types with varying permissions
- Authentication must be secure and compliant with PCI DSS and GDPR
- User registration workflows differ by user type (customer vs vendor)
- Multi-tenant isolation must be enforced at the user level
- Session management and security policies must be consistent
