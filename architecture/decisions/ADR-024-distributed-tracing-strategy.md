## 2. Summary

Implement a comprehensive distributed tracing strategy using Jaeger for the distributed e-commerce platform, providing end-to-end request tracing, performance analysis, and debugging capabilities across all microservices while maintaining minimal performance overhead and operational simplicity.

---

## 3. Problem & Context

The distributed e-commerce platform requires comprehensive distributed tracing to understand request flows, identify performance bottlenecks, and debug complex distributed system issues. While basic observability is covered in ADR-008, detailed distributed tracing patterns are needed for effective debugging and performance optimization.

**Current Situation:**
- Basic monitoring and observability implemented (ADR-008)
- Jaeger mentioned but no detailed implementation strategy
- Limited distributed tracing capabilities
- Difficult to debug cross-service issues
- No comprehensive performance analysis tools

**Challenges:**
- Trace complex request flows across multiple services
- Identify performance bottlenecks in distributed calls
- Debug distributed system failures and timeouts
- Correlate traces with logs and metrics
- Maintain trace data quality and sampling
- Integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure

)

func initTracer() {
    // Create Jaeger exporter
    exp, err := jaeger.New(jaeger.WithCollectorEndpoint(jaeger.WithEndpoint("http://jaeger:14268/api/traces")))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    
    // Create trace provider
    tp := trace.NewTracerProvider(
        trace.WithBatcher(exp),
        trace.WithSampler(trace.AlwaysSample()),
