- **Partitions**: 6-12 partitions per topic based on throughput requirements
- **Retention**: 7 days for business events, 30 days for audit events
- **Compression**: LZ4 compression for optimal performance

### Event Schema Design
```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid-v4",
  "eventType": "order.created",
  "eventVersion": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "source": "order-service",
  "data": {
    "orderId": "uuid-v4",
    "customerId": "uuid-v4",
    "items": [...],
    "total": 99.99
  },
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "uuid-v4",
    "causationId": "uuid-v4"
  }
}
```

### Event Schema Versioning Strategy

#### Versioning Approach
- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format
- **Backward Compatibility**: MINOR and PATCH versions must be backward compatible
- **Breaking Changes**: MAJOR version increments for breaking changes
- **Schema Registry**: Use Apache Avro with Confluent Schema Registry for schema management

#### Schema Evolution Strategies
1. **Additive Changes**: New optional fields (MINOR version)
2. **Non-Breaking Modifications**: Field renames, type widening (MINOR version)
3. **Breaking Changes**: Field removal, type narrowing (MAJOR version)
4. **Deprecation**: Mark fields as deprecated before removal

#### Versioning Implementation
```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid-v4",
  "eventType": "order.created",
  "eventVersion": "2.1.0",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "source": "order-service",
  "data": {
    "orderId": "uuid-v4",
    "customerId": "uuid-v4",
    "items": [...],
    "total": 99.99,
    "currency": "USD",           // New field in v2.0
    "shippingAddress": {...},    // New field in v2.1
    "legacyField": null          // Deprecated field, will be removed in v3.0
  },
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "uuid-v4",
    "causationId": "uuid-v4",
    "schemaVersion": "2.1.0"
  }
}
```

### CQRS Integration Strategy

#### Command and Query Separation
- **Command Side**: Handle write operations through event sourcing
- **Query Side**: Optimized read models for different use cases
- **Event Store**: Kafka as the primary event store
- **Read Models**: Separate databases optimized for specific queries

#### CQRS Implementation Pattern
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Command API   │───▶│  Command Handler│───▶│   Event Store   │
│                 │    │                 │     │    (Kafka)      │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                                                       │
                                                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Query API     │◀───│   Read Models   │◀───│  Event Handlers │
│                 │    │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

#### Read Model Synchronization
- **Event Handlers**: Process events and update read models
- **Eventual Consistency**: Read models updated asynchronously
- **Projection Patterns**: Materialized views for complex queries
- **Cache Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed data

### Saga Pattern Implementation Strategy

#### Saga Pattern Overview
The Saga pattern will be implemented to handle distributed transactions across multiple microservices, ensuring data consistency in complex business workflows like order processing.

#### Saga Implementation Types
- **Choreography-Based**: Services communicate directly through events
- **Orchestration-Based**: Centralized saga coordinator manages the workflow
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of both for complex scenarios

#### Order Processing Saga Example
```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Order       │───▶│ Payment     │───▶│ Inventory   │───▶│ Shipping    │
│ Created     │    │ Processed   │     │ Reserved    │     │ Scheduled   │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       │                   │                   │                   │
       ▼                   ▼                   ▼                   ▼
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ Order       │    │ Payment     │    │ Inventory   │    │ Shipping    │
│ Confirmed   │    │ Confirmed   │    │ Confirmed   │    │ Confirmed   │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

#### Saga Compensation Strategy
- **Compensation Events**: Each step has a corresponding compensation action
- **Eventual Consistency**: System eventually reaches consistent state
- **Monitoring**: Track saga progress and compensation events
- **Alerting**: Notify on saga failures and compensation triggers

#### Saga Implementation Details
```json
{
  "sagaId": "uuid-v4",
  "sagaType": "order.processing",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "currentStep": "inventory.reservation",
  "steps": [
    {
      "stepId": "order.creation",
      "status": "completed",
      "event": "order.created",
      "compensationEvent": "order.cancelled"
    },
    {
      "stepId": "payment.processing",
      "status": "completed",
      "event": "payment.processed",
      "compensationEvent": "payment.refunded"
    },
    {
      "stepId": "inventory.reservation",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "event": "inventory.reserved",
      "compensationEvent": "inventory.released"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "correlationId": "uuid-v4",
    "startTime": "ISO-8601",
    "timeout": "PT5M"
  }
}
```

### Topic Naming Convention
- `business.{domain}.{event-type}` (e.g., `business.orders.created`)
- `audit.{domain}.{event-type}` (e.g., `audit.orders.created`)
- `analytics.{domain}.{event-type}` (e.g., `analytics.orders.created`)

### Consumer Group Strategy
- **Order Service**: `order-service-consumer-group`
- **Inventory Service**: `inventory-service-consumer-group`
- **Analytics Service**: `analytics-service-consumer-group`
- **Audit Service**: `audit-service-consumer-group`

### Dead Letter Queue Strategy
- Failed messages sent to `{original-topic}.dlq` topic
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Alerting on DLQ message count
- Manual review and reprocessing workflow

### Integration Patterns

#### Service-to-Service Communication
- **Event-Driven Integration**: Services communicate through events rather than direct API calls
- **Loose Coupling**: Services are decoupled and can evolve independently
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes are captured as events
- **CQRS Integration**: Separate read and write models for optimal performance

#### External System Integration
- **API Gateway Integration**: Kafka Connect for external system integration
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications to external systems
- **Data Pipeline Integration**: Stream processing for analytics and reporting
- **Legacy System Integration**: Adapter patterns for existing systems

#### Integration Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   External      │     │   API Gateway   │     │   Kafka         │
│   Systems       │◀──▶│                 │◀──▶│   Connect       │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                                                       │
                                                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐

└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

#### Event Flow Patterns
- **Fan-Out**: Single event triggers multiple downstream services
- **Fan-In**: Multiple events converge to a single service
- **Pipeline**: Sequential processing of events through multiple services
- **Branching**: Conditional routing based on event content
- **Aggregation**: Combining multiple events into composite events

- **Backup Strategies**: Regular backup of topic data and configurations
- **Idempotent Processing**: Ensure consumers can handle duplicate messages
- **Monitoring**: Alert on failed message processing and DLQ growth

### Enhanced Error Handling Strategies

#### Error Classification and Handling
- **Transient Errors**: Network issues, temporary service unavailability
  - **Strategy**: Exponential backoff with jitter, retry up to 3 times
  - **Action**: Move to DLQ after max retries, alert operations team
  
- **Permanent Errors**: Schema validation failures, malformed data
  - **Strategy**: Immediate DLQ placement, no retry attempts
  - **Action**: Alert development team, manual investigation required
  
- **Business Logic Errors**: Invalid business rules, constraint violations
  - **Strategy**: Log error details, continue processing other messages
  - **Action**: Alert business team, update business rules if necessary

#### Retry Mechanisms
```json
{
  "retryPolicy": {
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "initialDelay": "PT1S",
    "maxDelay": "PT1M",
    "multiplier": 2.0,
    "jitter": 0.1
  },
  "errorHandling": {
    "transientErrors": ["ConnectionTimeout", "ServiceUnavailable"],
    "permanentErrors": ["SchemaValidationError", "MalformedData"],
    "businessErrors": ["InvalidOrder", "InsufficientInventory"]
  }
}
```

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Open State**: Stop processing messages when error threshold exceeded
- **Half-Open State**: Allow limited message processing to test recovery
- **Closed State**: Normal message processing when errors are below threshold
- **Thresholds**: 50% error rate triggers circuit breaker, 10% success rate closes it

#### Error Recovery Procedures
1. **Immediate Response**: Stop message processing, alert operations team
2. **Investigation**: Analyze error logs, identify root cause
3. **Recovery**: Fix underlying issue, restart affected services
4. **Verification**: Test message processing, monitor error rates
5. **Documentation**: Update runbooks, prevent future occurrences

#### Schema Evolution Risk: Breaking Changes
**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Schema Registry**: Centralized schema management and validation
- **Versioning Strategy**: Clear versioning approach with backward compatibility
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of schema changes before deployment
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to rollback to previous schema versions
- **Gradual Migration**: Support multiple schema versions during transition

### Performance Testing and Validation

#### Load Testing Scenarios
- **Normal Load**: 1,000 messages/second per topic
- **Peak Load**: 10,000 messages/second per topic (10x spike)
- **Sustained Load**: 5,000 messages/second for 1 hour
- **Burst Load**: 20,000 messages/second for 5 minutes

#### Performance Benchmarks
```json
{
  "latencyTargets": {
    "p50": "< 50ms",
    "p95": "< 100ms",
    "p99": "< 200ms",
    "p99.9": "< 500ms"
  },
  "throughputTargets": {
    "normal": "1,000 msg/sec",
    "peak": "10,000 msg/sec",
    "burst": "20,000 msg/sec"
  },
  "availabilityTargets": {
    "uptime": "99.9%",
    "messageDelivery": "99.9%",
    "consumerLag": "< 1 second"
  }
}
```

#### Testing Tools and Methodology
- **Kafka Performance Testing**: Use kafka-producer-perf-test and kafka-consumer-perf-test
- **Load Generation**: Custom load generators for business-specific scenarios
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection during testing
- **Validation**: Automated validation of performance targets

#### Capacity Planning
- **Storage Requirements**: 7 days retention for business events, 30 days for audit
- **Network Bandwidth**: 1 Gbps minimum, 10 Gbps recommended for production
- **CPU Resources**: 4-8 cores per broker for production workloads
- **Memory Requirements**: 16-32 GB RAM per broker for optimal performance
