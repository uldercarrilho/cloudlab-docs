# Architecture Principles

These principles guide architecture, design, and operational decisions across the platform. They encode our priorities, ensure consistent trade-offs, and make decisions explainable and repeatable.

## Goals and Priorities

- **Primary goals**: Security, reliability, and clarity for learning and maintainability.
- **Priority order for trade-offs**: Security → Availability → Correctness/Consistency (per domain) → Latency → Throughput → Cost → Developer Velocity.
- **Documentation-first**: Every significant decision requires an ADR before implementation. See `../decisions/ADR-016-documentation-knowledge-management.md`.

## Principles at a Glance

1. **ADR-first and documentation-as-code**
   - Decisions are captured in ADRs with rationale, alternatives, and consequences before implementation.
   - Documentation lives with code; PRs update both.

2. **Domain-driven boundaries and service autonomy**
   - Services map to clear bounded contexts; own their data; communicate via well-defined contracts.
   - Prefer smaller, cohesive services over large, coupled ones.

3. **API-first, contract-first**
   - Define OpenAPI/GraphQL contracts before implementation; treat contracts as versioned artifacts.
   - Backward-compatible changes by default; explicit versioning for breaking changes.

4. **Security-by-default (Zero Trust)**
   - Strong authentication and least-privilege authorization; encrypt in transit and at rest.
   - Validate inputs at boundaries; rotate secrets; audit sensitive actions.

5. **Observability built-in**
   - Standardized structured logging, metrics (SLIs), and distributed tracing in every service.
   - Dashboards and alerts are part of the definition of done.

6. **Resilience and failure isolation**
   - Timeouts, retries with jitter, circuit breakers, bulkheads, rate limits, and idempotency.
   - Prefer graceful degradation over outages; design for backpressure.

7. **Horizontal scalability and statelessness**
   - Stateless services; state externalized (databases, caches, object stores).
   - Scale out via replicas and autoscaling; avoid sticky sessions.

8. **Deliberate data consistency per domain**
   - Choose strong/eventual/causal consistency intentionally; document in ADRs.
   - Use CQRS and event sourcing where it clarifies write/read models and history.

9. **Asynchronous first for cross-service flows**
   - Prefer events and messaging for inter-service workflows; use Sagas for distributed transactions.
   - Use sync calls only for user-critical read paths; keep them shallow and fast.

10. **Compatibility and evolution**
    - Backward compatibility by default; additive changes preferred.
    - Use semantic versioning; deprecate with clear timelines and migration guides.

11. **Cloud-native, 12-factor alignment**
    - Immutable builds, configuration via environment, disposability, and parity across environments.

12. **Multi-region readiness and disaster recovery**
    - Design for region isolation, data locality, and controlled replication.
    - Define RTO/RPO per domain; regularly test failover and recovery.

13. **Performance and cost efficiency**
    - Set budgets (latency, throughput, cost) and measure; cache thoughtfully (cache-aside, write-through/behind).
    - Optimize the critical path; prefer simplicity over premature optimization.

14. **Compliance and governance**
    - Map data and services to regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI, GDPR) with auditable controls.
    - Default-deny posture for network and data access; data retention and deletion policies documented.

15. **Developer experience and automation**
    - CI/CD, templates, linters, and generators reduce toil; paved roads over bespoke setups.
    - Documentation and examples are part of deliverables.

## Decision Guardrails

- **ADR requirement**: New technology/tool/service, data model that affects interoperability, or cross-cutting change requires an ADR under `../decisions/` before implementation.
- **API contracts**: OpenAPI/GraphQL specs must accompany API changes; run contract tests in CI.
- **Data enums**: Database ENUMs must be mirrored by strongly-typed application enums; validate at boundaries.
- **SLIs/SLOs**: Define SLIs and SLOs per service (latency, error rate, saturation). Changes must include dashboards/alerts.
- **Security reviews**: Threat modeling and security checklist required for authz/authn and data-at-rest/ transit changes.
- **Operational readiness**: Runbooks, alerts, and rollback plans required before enabling new capabilities.

## Quality Gates (Definition of Done)

- Documentation updated: ADR (if applicable), guides, and READMEs.
- Observability: traces, logs, metrics wired; dashboards and alerts merged.
- Tests: unit, integration, and contract tests; resilience tests for timeouts/retries/idempotency.
- Performance: baseline measurements; budgets documented; critical endpoints under targets.
- Security: input validation, authz checks, secret handling; dependency scanning passes.

## How to Apply (Checklist)

- Clarify the bounded context and ownership for the change.
- Choose the consistency model and document trade-offs.
- Decide sync vs async; if async, model events and sagas.
- Define/extend the API contract; plan compatibility and versioning.
- Specify SLIs/SLOs and observability additions.
- Identify resilience patterns (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, idempotency keys).
- Update ADRs and documentation; include operational runbooks.
