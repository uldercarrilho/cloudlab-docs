## Consistency Patterns

### Strong Consistency Pattern

**Purpose**: Ensures that all nodes see the same data at the same time, providing ACID guarantees.

**Implementation**: Used for critical business operations like payment processing and inventory management.

**Use Cases**:
- Payment processing
- Inventory management
- Order status updates
- User authentication

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: ACID guarantees, predictable behavior
- **Cons**: Higher latency, reduced availability during partitions

### Eventual Consistency Pattern

**Purpose**: Provides high availability and performance by allowing temporary inconsistencies that resolve over time.

**Implementation**: Used for non-critical data like product reviews, user preferences, and analytics.

**Use Cases**:
- Product reviews and ratings
- User preferences
- Analytics and metrics
- Social features

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: High availability, low latency, better performance
- **Cons**: Temporary inconsistencies, complex conflict resolution

### Causal Consistency Pattern

**Purpose**: Ensures that causally related operations are seen in the correct order across all nodes.

**Implementation**: Used for user sessions, shopping cart updates, and related operations.

**Use Cases**:
- Shopping cart management
- User session data
- Related data updates
- Multi-step workflows

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Logical consistency, good performance
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, vector clock overhead

## Partitioning & Sharding Patterns

### Horizontal Partitioning Pattern

**Purpose**: Distributes data across multiple nodes based on a partition key to improve performance and scalability.

**Implementation**: Used for user data, product catalogs, and order data.

**Use Cases**:
- User data distribution
- Product catalog sharding
- Order data partitioning
- Analytics data distribution

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Linear scalability, improved performance
- **Cons**: Complex routing, potential data skew

### Vertical Partitioning Pattern

**Purpose**: Separates data by columns or attributes to optimize storage and access patterns.

**Implementation**: Used for separating frequently accessed data from rarely accessed data.

**Use Cases**:
- Product catalog optimization
- User profile data separation
- Order data optimization
- Analytics data management

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Optimized storage, better cache efficiency
- **Cons**: Complex queries, potential N+1 problems

## Replication Patterns

### Master-Slave Replication Pattern

**Purpose**: Provides read scalability and fault tolerance by maintaining one master for writes and multiple slaves for reads.

**Implementation**: Used for product catalog, user data, and order data.

**Use Cases**:

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Handles transient failures, improves reliability
- **Cons**: Increased latency, potential resource waste

## Load Balancing Patterns

### Round-Robin Load Balancing

**Purpose**: Distributes requests evenly across available nodes in a sequential manner.

**Implementation**: Used for stateless service instances and simple load distribution.

**Use Cases**:
- Stateless services
- Simple load distribution
- Development environments
- Basic scaling

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, even distribution
- **Cons**: No health checking, no performance awareness

### Weighted Round-Robin Load Balancing

**Purpose**: Distributes requests based on node capacity and performance characteristics.

**Implementation**: Used for heterogeneous node clusters and performance-based routing.

**Use Cases**:
- Heterogeneous clusters
- Performance-based routing
- Capacity-aware distribution
- Production environments

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Performance-aware, capacity-based distribution
- **Cons**: More complex, requires weight configuration

## Service Discovery Patterns

### Client-Side Service Discovery

**Implementation**: Used for microservice communication and client-side load balancing.

**Use Cases**:
- Microservice communication
- Client-side load balancing
- Service mesh integration
- Dynamic service discovery

**Trade-offs**:

- **Cons**: Client complexity, potential inconsistency

### Server-Side Service Discovery

**Purpose**: Load balancer or proxy handles service discovery and routing on behalf of clients.

**Implementation**: Used for external clients and simplified client implementations.

**Use Cases**:
- External client access
- Simplified client implementation
- Centralized routing
- API gateway integration

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Simplified clients, centralized control
