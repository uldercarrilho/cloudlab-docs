## üéØ Best Practices for AI Agents

### 1. Systematic Approach
- **Follow the template structure** consistently
- **Update progress regularly** (at least daily)
- **Document everything** - decisions, alternatives, learnings
- **Use quality gates** to ensure quality throughout

### 2. Architectural Thinking
- **Always consider the bigger picture** - how does this fit into the overall system?
- **Think about scalability** - what happens when load increases?
- **Plan for failure** - how does the system handle errors and edge cases?
- **Document trade-offs** - why did you choose one approach over another?

### 3. Knowledge Management
- **Capture learnings systematically** - what did you discover?
- **Document patterns** - what worked well and why?
- **Record troubleshooting steps** - how did you solve problems?
- **Share insights** - what should others know?

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Don't skip quality gates** - they're there for a reason
- **Test thoroughly** - validate against all success criteria
- **Document everything** - future you will thank you
- **Consider edge cases** - what could go wrong?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### 1. Incomplete Planning
**Problem**: Starting execution without proper planning
**Solution**: Complete all planning sections before starting implementation
**Check**: Ensure overview, context, and strategy sections are complete

### 2. Skipping Quality Gates
**Problem**: Bypassing validation checkpoints
**Solution**: Complete each quality gate before proceeding
**Check**: Quality gates are mandatory, not optional

### 3. Poor Progress Tracking
**Problem**: Inconsistent or missing progress updates
**Solution**: Update progress log systematically with timestamps
**Check**: Progress should be updated at least daily

### 4. Incomplete Documentation
**Problem**: Missing decision logs and learning capture
**Solution**: Document everything as you go
**Check**: Decision log and learning capture should grow throughout execution

### 5. Ignoring Architecture Impact
**Problem**: Focusing only on immediate functionality
**Solution**: Always consider distributed systems implications
**Check**: Architecture context sections should be comprehensive
