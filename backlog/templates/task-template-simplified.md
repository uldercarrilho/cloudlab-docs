**Completed**: 

## Description
Clear description of what needs to be accomplished and why this is valuable for learning distributed systems.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: What distributed systems concepts this teaches
- **Practical Experience**: Hands-on skills gained
- **Architecture Skills**: Architecture patterns or decisions involved
- **Portfolio**: How this demonstrates technical capability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable criterion 1
- [ ] Specific, testable criterion 2
- [ ] Specific, testable criterion 3
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code committed with tests

## Technical Approach
- **Technology choices**: What tools/frameworks to use
- **Version requirements**: MUST use latest stable versions - check before implementation
- **Implementation strategy**: High-level approach
- **Architecture considerations**: How this fits into overall system
- **Integration points**: What systems this connects to

## üîÑ Version Check Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Before starting implementation, verify and document:
1. **Latest Stable Versions**: Check official sites for current releases
2. **Compatibility**: Ensure versions work with existing project components
3. **Security**: Confirm latest security patches are included
4. **Document Choices**: Record exact versions and rationale (e.g., "Go 1.23.4 - latest stable with security fixes")

## Implementation Steps
1. Step 1: Specific action
2. Step 2: Specific action
3. Step 3: Specific action
4. Step 4: Testing and validation
5. Step 5: Documentation

## üìù Template Usage Notes

### For Solo Development
- **Check versions FIRST**: Always verify latest technology versions before starting
- Focus on learning objectives and practical experience
- Keep scope manageable (1-3 days maximum)
- Emphasize hands-on implementation over extensive planning
- Document learnings and decisions for future reference

### Distributed Systems Focus
- Always consider how this fits into larger system architecture
- Think about scalability, reliability, and performance implications
- Document trade-offs and design decisions
- Include relevant distributed systems patterns and concepts
