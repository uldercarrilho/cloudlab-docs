**Started**: 2025-08-14
**Completed**: 2025-08-14

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for compliance and regulatory requirements. This decision will establish how the distributed e-commerce platform meets various regulatory requirements including PCI DSS for payment processing, GDPR for data privacy, and other regional compliance standards.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding compliance requirements and regulatory frameworks in distributed systems
- **Foundation**: Establishes compliance backbone for all business operations and data handling
- **Architecture Skills**: Compliance architecture, data protection, and regulatory implementation
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in enterprise compliance and regulatory architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [x] PCI DSS compliance strategy for payment processing documented
- [x] GDPR compliance strategy for data privacy documented
- [x] Regional compliance requirements (CCPA, LGPD, etc.) analyzed
- [x] Data residency and sovereignty requirements defined
- [x] Audit and compliance monitoring strategies documented
- [x] Compliance automation and tooling strategies defined
- [x] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies documented

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of compliance requirements and regulatory frameworks
- **Evaluation**: Implementation complexity, cost, and operational impact
- **Pattern Analysis**: Compliance patterns, data protection, and audit strategies
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Compliance framework review and expert consultation

## Architecture Considerations
- **Payment Security**: PCI DSS Level 1 compliance for payment processing
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for EU user data handling
- **Regional Compliance**: CCPA (California), LGPD (Brazil), and other regional requirements
- **Data Residency**: Keep data within required geographic boundaries
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring for compliance audits
