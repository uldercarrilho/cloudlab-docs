**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 4 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-08-14
**Started**: 2025-08-14
**Completed**: 2025-08-14

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for search engine and analytics technologies. This decision will establish the search infrastructure, real-time analytics platform, and data processing strategies for the distributed e-commerce platform to provide fast product search and comprehensive business insights.

## Business Value

- **Foundation**: Establishes search and analytics backbone for business intelligence
- **Architecture Skills**: Search optimization, real-time analytics, and data processing patterns
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in search infrastructure and analytics platform design

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [x] Elasticsearch vs alternatives (Solr, Algolia, AWS OpenSearch) analysis completed
- [x] ClickHouse vs alternatives (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Apache Druid) analysis completed
- [x] Search optimization strategies and relevance tuning documented
- [x] Real-time analytics and streaming data processing defined
- [x] Data pipeline and ETL strategies documented
- [x] Performance requirements and SLAs defined
- [x] Cost-benefit analysis of search and analytics platforms completed

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of search engines and analytics platforms
- **Evaluation**: Performance, scalability, and operational characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Search optimization, analytics patterns, and data processing
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Performance testing and search quality evaluation

## Architecture Considerations
- **Search Performance**: Sub-100ms response times for product searches
- **Analytics Performance**: Real-time processing of business metrics
- **Scalability**: Handle large product catalogs and high query volumes

- **Operational Complexity**: Search relevance tuning and analytics maintenance

## Implementation Steps
1. Research search engine technologies (Elasticsearch, Solr, Algolia, AWS OpenSearch)
2. Analyze analytics database options (ClickHouse, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Apache Druid)
3. Evaluate search optimization strategies and relevance algorithms
4. Define real-time analytics and streaming data processing requirements
5. Document data pipeline and ETL strategies
6. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. Define performance requirements and SLAs
8. Document cost-benefit analysis and ROI calculations

## Learning Objectives
- Search engine architecture and optimization strategies
- Real-time analytics platform design and implementation
- Data processing patterns and ETL strategies
- Search relevance tuning and quality optimization
- Analytics performance optimization and monitoring
