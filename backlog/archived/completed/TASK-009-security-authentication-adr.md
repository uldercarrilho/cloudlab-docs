# [TASK-009] Create ADR for Security & Authentication

**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-08-13
**Started**: 2025-08-13
**Completed**: 2025-08-13

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for security and authentication strategies. This decision will establish the authentication mechanisms, authorization models, encryption standards, and security patterns for the distributed e-commerce platform, ensuring compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR requirements.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding security patterns and authentication strategies in distributed systems
- **Foundation**: Establishes security backbone for all business operations
- **Architecture Skills**: Security design, compliance requirements, and threat modeling
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in enterprise-grade security architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [x] OAuth2 + JWT vs alternatives analysis completed
- [x] RBAC vs alternatives (ABAC, PBAC) analysis completed
- [x] HashiCorp Vault vs alternatives analysis completed
- [x] Encryption standards (TLS 1.3, AES-256) documented
- [x] Multi-tenant security isolation strategy defined
- [x] Rate limiting and API security patterns documented
- [x] Compliance requirements (PCI DSS, GDPR) documented

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of security and authentication technologies
- **Evaluation**: Security, performance, and compliance characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Security patterns, threat modeling, and compliance strategies
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Security testing and compliance validation

## Architecture Considerations
- **Multi-tenant Security**: Complete isolation between tenants
- **Payment Security**: PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for user data handling
- **Performance**: Security overhead impact on response times
- **Operational Complexity**: Key management and security monitoring

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Research authentication mechanisms (OAuth2, SAML, OpenID Connect)
2. ✅ Analyze authorization models (RBAC, ABAC, PBAC)
3. ✅ Evaluate secret management solutions (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
4. ✅ Define encryption standards and key management strategies
5. ✅ Document multi-tenant security isolation patterns
6. ✅ Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. ✅ Define compliance requirements and validation strategies
8. ✅ Document threat modeling and security testing approaches

## Learning Objectives
- ✅ Security patterns and best practices in distributed systems
- ✅ Authentication and authorization model design
- ✅ Compliance requirements and implementation strategies
- ✅ Threat modeling and security testing
- ✅ Multi-tenant security architecture
