# [TASK-017] Create ADR for Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery

**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 4 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-08-14
**Started**: 2025-08-14
**Completed**: 2025-08-14

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for business continuity and disaster recovery strategies. This decision will establish how the distributed e-commerce platform maintains operations during and after various types of failures, ensuring business continuity and data recovery in disaster scenarios.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding business continuity and disaster recovery in distributed systems
- **Foundation**: Establishes resilience backbone for business operations during failures
- **Architecture Skills**: Disaster recovery planning, business continuity, and resilience engineering
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in enterprise-grade disaster recovery and business continuity

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [ ] Business continuity strategy and RTO/RPO requirements defined
- [ ] Disaster recovery strategies (backup, replication, failover) analyzed
- [ ] Multi-region failover and recovery strategies documented
- [ ] Data backup and recovery procedures defined
- [ ] Incident response and escalation procedures documented
- [ ] Testing and validation strategies for disaster recovery defined
- [ ] Cost analysis of disaster recovery strategies completed

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of business continuity and disaster recovery strategies
- **Evaluation**: Recovery time objectives, cost, and operational characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Disaster recovery patterns, failover strategies, and backup approaches
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Disaster recovery testing and validation strategies

## Architecture Considerations
- **Business Continuity**: Maintain 99.9% uptime even during failures
- **Recovery Objectives**: Define RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- **Data Protection**: Ensure no data loss during disaster scenarios
- **Geographic Distribution**: Multi-region failover capabilities
- **Cost Efficiency**: Balance recovery capabilities with infrastructure costs

## Implementation Steps
1. Research business continuity strategies and frameworks
2. Analyze disaster recovery approaches (backup, replication, failover)
3. Evaluate multi-region failover and recovery strategies
4. Define RTO/RPO requirements for different business functions
5. Document data backup and recovery procedures
6. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. Define incident response and escalation procedures
8. Document testing and validation strategies

## Learning Objectives
- Business continuity planning and implementation
- Disaster recovery strategies and failover mechanisms
- Multi-region recovery and geographic distribution
- Data backup and recovery procedures
- Incident response and business continuity testing

- Knowledge of disaster recovery strategies
- Access to infrastructure for disaster recovery testing

## Progress Log
<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Risk Assessment
- **Recovery Risk**: Inability to recover from disasters - *Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and validation*
- **Cost Risk**: High disaster recovery infrastructure costs - *Mitigation: Phased implementation approach*
- **Complexity Risk**: Complex failover mechanisms - *Mitigation: Start with simple active-passive setup*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ADR document completed and reviewed
- [ ] Decision matrix with all alternatives documented
- [ ] Business continuity strategy defined with rationale
- [ ] Disaster recovery approach documented
- [ ] RTO/RPO requirements established
- [ ] Testing and validation strategy defined

## Follow-up Tasks
- TASK-018: Create ADR for Team Collaboration & Communication
- TASK-019: Create ADR for Cost Optimization & Resource Management
- TASK-020: Implement disaster recovery proof of concept
