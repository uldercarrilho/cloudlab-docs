# [TASK-011] Create ADR for Performance & Caching

**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-08-13
**Started**: 2025-08-13
**Completed**: 2025-08-13

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for performance optimization and caching strategies. This decision will establish the multi-level caching approach, CDN strategy, and performance optimization patterns for the distributed e-commerce platform to achieve sub-200ms response times and handle 10x traffic spikes.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding performance optimization and caching strategies in distributed systems
- **Foundation**: Establishes performance backbone for all user interactions
- **Architecture Skills**: Caching patterns, CDN optimization, and performance engineering
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in high-performance system design and optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [x] Multi-level caching strategy (Redis, application, CDN) analysis completed
- [x] CDN provider selection (CloudFlare vs AWS CloudFront vs alternatives) completed
- [x] Caching patterns (Cache-Aside, Write-Through, Write-Behind) analysis completed
- [x] Performance targets and SLAs documented
- [x] Cache invalidation and consistency strategies defined
- [x] Performance monitoring and optimization strategies documented
- [x] Cost-benefit analysis of caching strategies completed

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of caching technologies and performance optimization strategies
- **Evaluation**: Performance, cost, and operational characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Caching patterns, CDN strategies, and performance optimization
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Performance testing and benchmarking

## Architecture Considerations
- **Performance Targets**: Sub-200ms response times for 95th percentile
- **Scalability**: Handle 10x traffic spikes during sales events
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >95% for frequently accessed data
- **Cost Efficiency**: Balance performance gains with infrastructure costs
- **Operational Complexity**: Cache management and invalidation overhead

## Implementation Steps
1. Research caching technologies (Redis, Memcached, Hazelcast)
2. Analyze CDN providers (CloudFlare, AWS CloudFront, Fastly, Akamai)
3. Evaluate caching patterns (Cache-Aside, Write-Through, Write-Behind)
4. Define performance targets and SLAs
5. Document cache invalidation and consistency strategies
6. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. Define performance monitoring and optimization approaches
8. Document cost-benefit analysis and ROI calculations

## Learning Objectives
- Multi-level caching strategies and implementation
- CDN optimization and content delivery strategies
- Performance engineering and optimization techniques
- Cache invalidation and consistency patterns
- Performance monitoring and benchmarking
