# [TASK-006] Create ADR for API & Communication Patterns

**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-08-12
**Started**: 2025-08-12
**Completed**: 2025-08-12

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for API design and communication patterns. This decision will establish how services expose APIs, communicate with each other, and handle different types of interactions (synchronous, asynchronous, real-time) across the distributed e-commerce platform.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding API design patterns and communication protocols in distributed systems
- **Foundation**: Establishes interface contracts and communication standards
- **Architecture Skills**: API design, GraphQL implementation, and protocol selection
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in modern API architecture and communication patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [ ] GraphQL vs REST vs gRPC analysis completed for different use cases
- [ ] Internal service communication protocol (gRPC) analysis completed
- [ ] Real-time communication (WebSocket) strategy defined
- [ ] API versioning and evolution strategy documented
- [ ] Rate limiting and security patterns defined
- [ ] Performance and scalability requirements documented
- [ ] API documentation and testing strategy defined

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of API technologies and communication protocols
- **Evaluation**: Performance, developer experience, and operational characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: API design patterns, versioning strategies, and security
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Performance testing and developer experience evaluation

## Architecture Considerations
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms response times for API calls
- **Developer Experience**: Frontend integration and API usability
- **Scalability**: Handle 10,000 requests/second peak capacity
- **Security**: Multi-tenant isolation and rate limiting
- **Operational Complexity**: API monitoring, debugging, and maintenance

## Implementation Steps
1. Research API technologies (GraphQL, REST, gRPC) for different use cases
2. Analyze internal service communication protocols (gRPC, HTTP/2)
3. Evaluate real-time communication options (WebSocket, Server-Sent Events)
4. Define API versioning and evolution strategies
5. Document rate limiting and security patterns
6. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. Define API documentation and testing requirements
8. Document performance benchmarks and SLAs

## Learning Objectives
- API design patterns and best practices
- Communication protocol selection and trade-offs
- GraphQL implementation and optimization
- API versioning and evolution strategies
- Real-time communication in distributed systems

## Resources
- [ADR Template](../../architecture/decisions/)
- [GraphQL Documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/)
- [gRPC Documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/)
- [REST API Design](https://restfulapi.net/)
- [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
- [API Versioning Strategies](https://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api#versioning)

## Dependencies
- Understanding of API design principles
- Knowledge of communication protocols
- Access to tools for API testing and performance evaluation

## Progress Log
<!-- Update as work progresses -->
- **2025-08-12**: Task started - Beginning research on API communication patterns
- **2025-08-12**: Status updated to In Progress, starting ADR document creation
- **2025-08-12**: ADR-006 document completed - Comprehensive API communication patterns ADR created
- **2025-08-12**: Task completed - All acceptance criteria met

## Risk Assessment
- **Complexity Risk**: GraphQL learning curve - *Mitigation: Start with simple queries*
- **Performance Risk**: N+1 query problems - *Mitigation: Implement data loaders*
- **Operational Risk**: Complex API debugging - *Mitigation: Comprehensive monitoring*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ADR document completed and reviewed
- [ ] Decision matrix with all alternatives documented
- [ ] API design patterns defined for each use case
- [ ] Communication protocols selected with rationale
- [ ] API versioning strategy documented
