## 🏗️ Distributed Systems Context

### Architectural Impact
**System-Wide Implications:**
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Templates must integrate with Istio service mesh for traffic management
- **Cross-Service Communication**: Establish patterns for synchronous (gRPC) and asynchronous (Kafka) communication
- **Data Consistency**: Implement patterns for strong consistency (orders) and eventual consistency (catalog)
- **Service Discovery**: Built-in service registration and discovery mechanisms
- **API Gateway Integration**: Consistent patterns for API gateway routing and authentication

**Microservices Architecture:**
- **Service Boundaries**: Clear separation of concerns between business domains
- **Shared Libraries**: Common patterns for cross-cutting concerns
- **Configuration Management**: Externalized configuration via environment variables and config maps
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean dependency management for testability and maintainability

### Scalability Considerations
**Horizontal Scaling Patterns:**
- **Stateless Design**: Templates enforce stateless service patterns
- **Load Balancing**: Built-in support for multiple load balancing strategies
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes-native scaling patterns with resource management
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database and service connection management
- **Caching Strategies**: Multi-level caching patterns (application, Redis, CDN)

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized Go patterns for memory and CPU usage
- **Database Optimization**: Connection pooling, query optimization, and index management
- **Network Efficiency**: gRPC for internal communication, GraphQL for flexible client queries
- **Monitoring Integration**: Performance metrics and profiling capabilities

### Reliability Patterns
**Fault Tolerance:**
- **Circuit Breakers**: Protection against cascading failures
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Exponential backoff and jitter patterns
- **Timeout Management**: Appropriate timeouts for different operation types
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms for non-critical functionality
- **Health Checks**: Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes

**Error Handling:**
- **Structured Error Responses**: Consistent error formats across all services
- **Error Propagation**: Proper error context and tracing across service boundaries
- **Logging Standards**: Structured logging for effective debugging and monitoring
- **Alerting Integration**: Automatic alerting for critical error conditions

### Integration Complexity
**Service Communication:**
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: gRPC for internal, REST for external, GraphQL for flexible queries
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Kafka integration for asynchronous communication
- **Schema Evolution**: Backward-compatible API versioning strategies
- **Data Serialization**: Protocol Buffers for gRPC, JSON for REST

**External System Integration:**
- **Database Patterns**: Multi-database support with appropriate drivers
- **Message Queue Integration**: Kafka producer/consumer patterns
- **Monitoring Systems**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger integration
- **Cloud Services**: AWS SDK integration for managed services
