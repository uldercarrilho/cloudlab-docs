## 2. Executive Summary

Create a comprehensive Docker Compose development environment that supports the entire distributed e-commerce platform architecture. This environment will enable local development, testing, and debugging of all microservices with proper service discovery, networking, and data persistence.

**Business Value**: Provides foundation for all development work, enabling rapid iteration and testing of distributed systems patterns.

---

## 3. Context & Background

### Problem Statement
The distributed e-commerce platform requires a complex infrastructure with multiple services, databases, and messaging systems. Developers need a consistent, reproducible local development environment that mirrors production architecture while remaining easy to set up and maintain.

### Reference Architecture
From [system-overview.md](../../architecture/overview/system-overview.md), the platform consists of:
- **10 Go microservices**: Auth, User, Product, Order, Payment, Inventory, Search, Content, Analytics, Notification
- **4 database systems**: PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse, Elasticsearch
- **Message queue**: Apache Kafka (KRaft mode - no Zookeeper)
- **API Gateway**: For external client requests
- **Service mesh capabilities**: For internal service communication

### Repository Structure Context
From [repository-guidance.md](../../ai-sessions/repository-guidance.md):
- **platform repo**: Core backend services (Go microservices)
- **web repo**: React frontend application
- **admin repo**: Administrative dashboard
- **infrastructure repo**: Docker Compose, Kubernetes and Terraform configs (IMPLEMENTATION LOCATION)
- **docs repo**: Architecture and documentation

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTE**: The Docker Compose development environment was implemented in the **infrastructure** repository, which is the appropriate location for development environment configurations.
