- Improved performance and resource utilization
- Access to newer features for learning distributed systems concepts
- Extended LTS support and community assistance
- Better compatibility with modern cloud providers and tools

**Version Management Considerations:**
- Test version compatibility in development environment first
- Document any version-specific configurations or workarounds

- Use Helm chart version constraints for reproducible deployments

### Risks & Mitigation
**Risk**: Kubernetes complexity overwhelming
**Mitigation**: Start with basic manifests, incrementally add advanced features

**Risk**: Resource constraints in development environment
**Mitigation**: Use resource limits and local cluster optimization

**Risk**: Service mesh complexity
**Mitigation**: Implement Istio gradually, start with basic traffic management
