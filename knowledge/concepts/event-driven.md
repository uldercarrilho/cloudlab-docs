# Event-Driven Architecture Concepts

## Overview

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a fundamental pattern in distributed systems that enables loose coupling, scalability, and resilience through asynchronous communication. This document covers the core concepts, patterns, and implementation strategies for event-driven systems.

## Core Principles

### 1. Event-First Design
- **Events as Facts**: Events represent things that have happened in the system
- **Immutable History**: Events are immutable records of past occurrences
- **Temporal Ordering**: Events have timestamps and can be ordered chronologically
- **Causality**: Events can have causal relationships and dependencies

### 2. Loose Coupling
- **Producer Independence**: Event producers don't need to know about consumers
- **Consumer Autonomy**: Consumers can process events independently
- **Interface Contracts**: Events define the contract between components
- **Evolution Support**: Systems can evolve without breaking existing integrations

### 3. Asynchronous Communication
- **Non-Blocking**: Producers don't wait for consumer processing
- **Fire-and-Forget**: Events are sent without expecting immediate responses
- **Eventual Consistency**: Systems achieve consistency over time
- **Resilience**: Failures in one component don't cascade to others

## Event Types and Patterns

### 1. Domain Events
```go
// Example: OrderCreated event
type OrderCreated struct {
    EventID      string    `json:"event_id" db:"event_id"`
    AggregateID  string    `json:"aggregate_id" db:"aggregate_id"`
    EventType    string    `json:"event_type" db:"event_type"`
    EventData    OrderData `json:"event_data" db:"event_data"`
    OccurredAt   time.Time `json:"occurred_at" db:"occurred_at"`
    Version      int       `json:"version" db:"version"`
    Source       string    `json:"source" db:"source"`
}

type OrderData struct {
    OrderID      string  `json:"order_id"`
    CustomerID   string  `json:"customer_id"`
    TotalAmount  float64 `json:"total_amount"`
    Items        []Item  `json:"items"`
}
```

### 2. Integration Events
- **Cross-Boundary Communication**: Events that cross service boundaries
- **External System Integration**: Events for third-party system communication
- **API Gateway Events**: Events for client-facing API interactions
- **Monitoring Events**: Events for observability and alerting

### 3. System Events
- **Infrastructure Events**: Resource provisioning, scaling, failures
- **Health Check Events**: Service status and availability
- **Configuration Events**: Dynamic configuration changes
- **Security Events**: Authentication, authorization, and audit events

## Event Sourcing

### 1. Event Store
```sql
-- Event store table with comprehensive comments
CREATE TABLE event_store (
    event_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    aggregate_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Unique identifier for the aggregate root',
    event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Type of event (e.g., OrderCreated, PaymentProcessed)',
    event_data JSONB NOT NULL COMMENT 'Event payload as JSON with schema validation',
    occurred_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL COMMENT 'When the event occurred (UTC)',
    version INTEGER NOT NULL COMMENT 'Event version for optimistic concurrency control',
    source VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL COMMENT 'Service or component that produced the event',
    correlation_id UUID COMMENT 'Correlation ID for tracing related events across services',
    causation_id UUID COMMENT 'ID of the event that caused this event',
    metadata JSONB COMMENT 'Additional context and headers for the event',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() COMMENT 'When this record was created'
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_event_store_aggregate_id ON event_store(aggregate_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_event_store_event_type ON event_store(event_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_event_store_occurred_at ON event_store(occurred_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_event_store_correlation_id ON event_store(correlation_id);
```

### 2. Event Replay and Projections
- **Event Replay**: Rebuilding state by replaying events
- **Projections**: Building read models from event streams
- **Snapshots**: Periodic state snapshots for performance
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation

## Message Queue Patterns

### 1. Point-to-Point (Queue)
- **Single Consumer**: Each message is processed by one consumer
- **Load Distribution**: Multiple consumers can share the load
- **Guaranteed Delivery**: Messages are not lost
- **Ordering**: Messages can be processed in order

### 2. Publish-Subscribe (Topic)
- **Multiple Consumers**: Each message is sent to all subscribers
- **Fan-out Pattern**: One producer, many consumers
- **Decoupled Communication**: Producers and consumers are independent
- **Event Broadcasting**: Notifications to all interested parties

### 3. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
- **Failed Message Handling**: Messages that can't be processed
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Error Analysis**: Investigation of processing failures
- **Manual Intervention**: Human review of problematic messages

## Event Processing Patterns

### 1. Event Handlers
```go
// Example: Event handler interface
type EventHandler interface {
    HandleEvent(ctx context.Context, event Event) error
    EventType() string
    Priority() int
}

// Example: Order event handler
type OrderEventHandler struct {
    orderService    OrderService
    inventoryService InventoryService
    logger          Logger
}

func (h *OrderEventHandler) HandleEvent(ctx context.Context, event Event) error {
    switch event.EventType() {
    case "OrderCreated":
        return h.handleOrderCreated(ctx, event)
    case "OrderCancelled":
        return h.handleOrderCancelled(ctx, event)
    default:
        h.logger.Warn("Unknown event type", "event_type", event.EventType())
        return nil
    }
}
```

### 2. Event Processors
- **Sequential Processing**: Events processed one at a time
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple events processed concurrently
- **Batch Processing**: Events processed in batches for efficiency
- **Stream Processing**: Continuous processing of event streams

### 3. Event Aggregators
- **Event Correlation**: Grouping related events
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying event patterns
- **Business Rules**: Applying business logic to event combinations
- **Decision Making**: Triggering actions based on event patterns

## Consistency Patterns

### 1. Eventual Consistency
- **Asynchronous Updates**: Changes propagate over time
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling concurrent modifications
- **Compensation Actions**: Undoing or correcting actions
- **Saga Pattern**: Managing distributed transactions

### 2. Strong Consistency
- **Synchronous Processing**: Immediate consistency guarantees
- **Two-Phase Commit**: Distributed transaction coordination
- **Pessimistic Locking**: Preventing concurrent modifications
- **Serializable Isolation**: Highest isolation level

### 3. Causal Consistency
- **Causal Ordering**: Events respect cause-and-effect relationships
- **Vector Clocks**: Tracking causal dependencies
- **Partial Ordering**: Some events can be processed in parallel
- **Eventual Convergence**: Systems converge to consistent state

## Resilience and Fault Tolerance

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern is a resilience strategy used to prevent cascading failures in distributed and event-driven systems. When an event processor or handler experiences repeated failures (such as being unable to process events due to downstream service outages), the circuit breaker temporarily "opens" to stop further processing attempts. This prevents overwhelming the system with repeated failed operations and allows time for recovery.

The circuit breaker typically operates in three states:
- **Closed**: Normal operation; events are processed as usual. If failures exceed a defined threshold, the circuit transitions to the "Open" state.
- **Open**: Event processing is halted immediately, and failures are returned without attempting to process events. After a timeout period, the circuit transitions to "Half-Open."
- **Half-Open**: A limited number of events are allowed through to test if the underlying issue has been resolved. If successful, the circuit returns to "Closed"; if failures persist, it reopens.

This pattern improves system stability by isolating faults, reducing error amplification, and enabling graceful recovery from transient failures.

### 2. Retry Mechanisms
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delay between retries
- **Jitter**: Random variation in retry timing
- **Maximum Retries**: Preventing infinite retry loops
- **Retry Policies**: Configurable retry strategies

### 3. Dead Letter Queues
- **Failed Event Storage**: Persistent storage of failed events
- **Error Analysis**: Investigation of processing failures
- **Manual Recovery**: Human intervention for complex failures
- **Monitoring**: Alerting on DLQ growth

## Monitoring and Observability

### 1. Event Metrics
- **Event Volume**: Number of events processed per time period
- **Processing Latency**: Time from event creation to processing
- **Error Rates**: Percentage of events that fail processing
- **Queue Depths**: Number of events waiting to be processed

### 2. Distributed Tracing
- **Event Correlation**: Tracking events across service boundaries
- **Causation Chains**: Understanding event dependencies
- **Performance Analysis**: Identifying bottlenecks in event processing
- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting distributed event flows

### 3. Event Logging
```go
// Example: Structured event logging
type EventLogger struct {
    logger Logger
}

func (l *EventLogger) LogEvent(event Event, metadata map[string]interface{}) {
    l.logger.Info("Event processed",
        "event_id", event.EventID,
        "event_type", event.EventType,
        "aggregate_id", event.AggregateID,
        "occurred_at", event.OccurredAt,
        "processing_time", time.Since(event.OccurredAt),
        "metadata", metadata,
    )
}
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Event Authentication
- **Producer Verification**: Ensuring events come from authorized sources
- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographic verification of event integrity
- **Access Control**: Limiting who can produce and consume events
- **Audit Logging**: Recording all event-related activities

### 2. Event Encryption
- **Data at Rest**: Encrypting stored events
- **Data in Transit**: Encrypting events during transmission
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Encrypting sensitive data fields
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage and rotation

### 3. Privacy and Compliance
- **Data Minimization**: Only collecting necessary event data
- **Retention Policies**: Automatically deleting old events
- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to be forgotten implementation
- **Data Masking**: Anonymizing sensitive information

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Event Batching
- **Batch Processing**: Processing multiple events together
- **Batch Size Optimization**: Finding optimal batch sizes
- **Parallel Processing**: Processing batches concurrently
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage for large batches

### 2. Event Compression
- **Data Compression**: Reducing event storage and transmission size
- **Schema Evolution**: Efficient handling of schema changes
- **Delta Encoding**: Storing only changes between events
- **Compression Algorithms**: Choosing appropriate compression methods

### 3. Caching Strategies
- **Event Cache**: Caching frequently accessed events
- **Projection Cache**: Caching read model projections
- **Metadata Cache**: Caching event metadata and schemas
- **Cache Invalidation**: Strategies for keeping caches fresh

## Implementation Examples

### 1. Event Bus Implementation
```go
// Example: Simple event bus
type EventBus struct {
    handlers map[string][]EventHandler
    mutex    sync.RWMutex
}

func (eb *EventBus) Subscribe(eventType string, handler EventHandler) {
    eb.mutex.Lock()
    defer eb.mutex.Unlock()
    
    eb.handlers[eventType] = append(eb.handlers[eventType], handler)
}

func (eb *EventBus) Publish(ctx context.Context, event Event) error {
    eb.mutex.RLock()
    handlers := eb.handlers[event.EventType()]
    eb.mutex.RUnlock()
    
    for _, handler := range handlers {
        go func(h EventHandler) {
            if err := h.HandleEvent(ctx, event); err != nil {
                // Handle error (log, retry, DLQ, etc.)
            }
        }(handler)
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

### 2. Event Store Implementation
```go
// Example: Event store interface
type EventStore interface {
    AppendEvents(ctx context.Context, aggregateID string, events []Event) error
    GetEvents(ctx context.Context, aggregateID string, fromVersion int) ([]Event, error)
    GetEventsByType(ctx context.Context, eventType string, limit int) ([]Event, error)
    GetEventsSince(ctx context.Context, since time.Time, limit int) ([]Event, error)
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Event Design
- **Immutable Events**: Events should never change after creation
- **Schema Versioning**: Handle schema evolution gracefully
- **Event Naming**: Use clear, descriptive event names
- **Event Size**: Keep events small and focused

### 2. Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing when possible
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle unprocessable events
- **Retry Strategies**: Implement appropriate retry logic
- **Monitoring**: Track and alert on processing failures

### 3. Testing
- **Event Testing**: Test event creation and processing
- **Integration Testing**: Test event flow across services
- **Performance Testing**: Test event processing performance
- **Failure Testing**: Test system behavior under failure conditions

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 1. Event Sourcing Everything
- **Over-Engineering**: Not all systems need event sourcing
- **Complexity**: Event sourcing adds complexity
- **Performance**: Event replay can be slow
- **Storage**: Event stores can grow very large

### 2. Ignoring Event Ordering
- **Race Conditions**: Events processed out of order
- **Data Inconsistency**: Incorrect state due to ordering issues
- **Business Logic Errors**: Incorrect business decisions
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Hard to trace issues

### 3. Synchronous Event Processing
- **Tight Coupling**: Services become dependent on each other
- **Performance Issues**: Slow response times
- **Scalability Problems**: Hard to scale horizontally
- **Failure Propagation**: Failures cascade across services

## Conclusion

Event-driven architecture provides a powerful foundation for building scalable, resilient distributed systems. By understanding and implementing these patterns correctly, you can create systems that are loosely coupled, highly available, and easy to maintain and extend.

The key is to start simple and gradually add complexity as needed, always keeping in mind the principles of loose coupling, asynchronous communication, and eventual consistency. Remember to implement proper monitoring, error handling, and testing to ensure your event-driven system operates reliably in production.
