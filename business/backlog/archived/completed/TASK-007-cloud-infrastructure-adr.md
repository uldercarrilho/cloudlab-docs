# [TASK-007] Create ADR for Cloud & Infrastructure

**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-08-13
**Started**: 2025-08-13
**Completed**: 2025-08-13

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for cloud provider and infrastructure choices. This decision will establish the cloud platform, infrastructure as code tools, and deployment strategies for the distributed e-commerce platform, including multi-region support and cost optimization.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding cloud architecture and infrastructure as code practices
- **Foundation**: Establishes cloud platform that affects all infrastructure decisions
- **Architecture Skills**: Multi-region deployment, cost optimization, and cloud-native patterns
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in cloud architecture and infrastructure automation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [ ] AWS vs alternatives (GCP, Azure, multi-cloud) analysis completed
- [ ] Terraform vs alternatives (CloudFormation, Pulumi) analysis completed
- [ ] Multi-region deployment strategy documented
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code patterns and practices defined
- [ ] Cost optimization strategies documented
- [ ] Disaster recovery and backup strategies defined
- [ ] Compliance and security requirements documented

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of cloud providers and infrastructure tools
- **Evaluation**: Cost, performance, and operational characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Cloud-native architecture and 12-factor app principles
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Cost analysis and performance benchmarking

## Architecture Considerations
- **Global Reach**: Multi-region deployment for low-latency user experience
- **Cost Efficiency**: Infrastructure costs and optimization strategies
- **Compliance**: PCI DSS for payment data, GDPR for user data
- **Operational Complexity**: Team skills and operational overhead
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Migration strategies and portability considerations

## Implementation Steps
1. Research cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, multi-cloud strategies)
2. Analyze infrastructure as code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi)
3. Evaluate multi-region deployment strategies and patterns
4. Define cost optimization and resource management approaches
5. Document disaster recovery and backup strategies
6. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. Define compliance and security requirements
8. Document migration and rollback strategies

## Learning Objectives
- Cloud architecture patterns and best practices
- Infrastructure as Code implementation and management
- Multi-region deployment strategies
- Cost optimization and resource management
- Cloud-native application design principles

## Progress Log
<!-- Update as work progresses -->

### 2025-08-13 - Task Started
- **Status**: Task picked up and moved to In Progress
- **Next Steps**: Begin research on cloud providers and infrastructure tools
- **Progress**: 5% - Task initialization complete

### 2025-08-13 - Task Completed
- **Status**: Comprehensive ADR document created and completed
- **Deliverables**: ADR-007-cloud-infrastructure.md with detailed analysis and implementation strategy
- **Progress**: 100% - All acceptance criteria met
- **Key Decisions**: AWS as primary cloud provider, Terraform for Infrastructure as Code, multi-region strategy

## Risk Assessment
- **Vendor Lock-in Risk**: Cloud provider dependency - *Mitigation: Multi-cloud strategy consideration*
- **Cost Risk**: Unexpected infrastructure costs - *Mitigation: Cost monitoring and optimization*
- **Complexity Risk**: Multi-region deployment complexity - *Mitigation: Start with single region*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ADR document completed and reviewed
- [ ] Decision matrix with all alternatives documented
- [ ] Cloud provider selected with rationale
- [ ] Multi-region strategy defined
- [ ] Cost optimization strategies documented
- [ ] Compliance and security requirements established

## Follow-up Tasks
- TASK-008: Create ADR for Monitoring & Observability
- TASK-009: Create ADR for Security & Authentication
- TASK-010: Implement infrastructure proof of concept
