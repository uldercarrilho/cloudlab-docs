```

**Simple Approach**: Task files are moved directly to `completed/` or `cancelled/` directories when done. For larger projects, you can organize by date or theme as needed.

## üéØ Archive Purpose

### Learning and Reference
- **Learning documentation**: Preserve what was learned from each task
- **Decision history**: Track technical decisions and their outcomes
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify successful approaches for future tasks
- **Knowledge preservation**: Maintain record of distributed systems implementations

### Solo Development Benefits
- **Progress tracking**: See what has been accomplished over time
- **Skill development**: Track learning progression in distributed systems
- **Portfolio building**: Maintain record of completed projects
- **Future reference**: Refer back to successful implementations

## üìä Archive Organization (Solo Development)

### Simple Structure
- **Direct placement**: Move completed task files directly to `completed/`
- **Chronological order**: Files naturally ordered by completion date
- **Future organization**: Can organize by theme or date as collection grows

### Optional Organization (for larger projects)
- **By month**: Create subdirectories like `2024-01/`, `2024-02/` if needed
- **By theme**: Group related distributed systems topics together
- **By complexity**: Separate simple vs complex implementations
