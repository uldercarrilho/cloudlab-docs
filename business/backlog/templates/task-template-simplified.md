## üìù Template Usage Notes

### For Solo Development
- Focus on learning objectives and practical experience
- Keep scope manageable (1-3 days maximum)
- Emphasize hands-on implementation over extensive planning
- Document learnings and decisions for future reference

### Distributed Systems Focus
- Always consider how this fits into larger system architecture
- Think about scalability, reliability, and performance implications
- Document trade-offs and design decisions
- Include relevant distributed systems patterns and concepts
