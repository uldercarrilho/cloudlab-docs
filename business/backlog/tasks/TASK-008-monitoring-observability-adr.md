# [TASK-008] Create ADR for Monitoring & Observability

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Started**: 
**Completed**: 

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for monitoring and observability technologies. This decision will establish the monitoring stack, logging strategy, distributed tracing, and alerting systems for the distributed e-commerce platform to ensure full visibility into system performance and user behavior.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding observability patterns and monitoring strategies in distributed systems
- **Foundation**: Establishes monitoring backbone for operational excellence
- **Architecture Skills**: Observability design, metrics collection, and alerting strategies
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in comprehensive system monitoring and debugging

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [ ] Prometheus + Grafana vs alternatives analysis completed
- [ ] ELK Stack vs alternatives (Loki, Splunk) analysis completed
- [ ] Jaeger vs alternatives (Zipkin, AWS X-Ray) analysis completed
- [ ] APM tool selection (New Relic vs Datadog) completed
- [ ] Alerting strategy and PagerDuty integration defined
- [ ] Health check and readiness probe strategies documented
- [ ] Performance monitoring and SLI/SLO definitions documented

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of monitoring and observability technologies
- **Evaluation**: Performance, cost, and operational characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Observability patterns, metrics collection, and alerting strategies
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Performance testing and integration validation

## Architecture Considerations
- **Real-time Visibility**: 99.9% uptime monitoring and alerting
- **Performance Tracking**: Sub-200ms response time monitoring
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracking across services
- **Cost Efficiency**: Monitoring infrastructure costs and optimization
- **Operational Complexity**: Team skills and maintenance overhead

## Implementation Steps
1. Research metrics collection (Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite)
2. Analyze logging solutions (ELK Stack, Loki, Splunk)
3. Evaluate distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray)
4. Compare APM tools (New Relic, Datadog, AppDynamics)
5. Define alerting and notification strategies
6. Document health check and readiness probe approaches
7. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
8. Define SLI/SLO metrics and monitoring requirements

## Learning Objectives
- Observability patterns and best practices
- Metrics collection and visualization strategies
- Distributed tracing implementation and optimization
- Logging aggregation and analysis
- Performance monitoring and alerting design

## Resources

- Access to infrastructure for monitoring tool testing

## Progress Log
<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Risk Assessment
- **Complexity Risk**: Observability stack learning curve - *Mitigation: Start with simple metrics*
- **Performance Risk**: Monitoring overhead - *Mitigation: Careful sampling and filtering*
- **Cost Risk**: High monitoring infrastructure costs - *Mitigation: Start with open-source tools*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ADR document completed and reviewed
- [ ] Decision matrix with all alternatives documented
- [ ] Monitoring stack selected with rationale
- [ ] Observability patterns defined
- [ ] Alerting strategy documented
- [ ] SLI/SLO metrics defined

## Follow-up Tasks
- TASK-009: Create ADR for Security & Authentication
- TASK-010: Create ADR for CI/CD & Deployment
- TASK-011: Implement monitoring proof of concept
