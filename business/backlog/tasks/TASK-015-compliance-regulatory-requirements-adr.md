# [TASK-015] Create ADR for Compliance & Regulatory Requirements

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 4 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Started**: 
**Completed**: 

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for compliance and regulatory requirements. This decision will establish how the distributed e-commerce platform meets various regulatory requirements including PCI DSS for payment processing, GDPR for data privacy, and other regional compliance standards.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding compliance requirements and regulatory frameworks in distributed systems
- **Foundation**: Establishes compliance backbone for all business operations and data handling
- **Architecture Skills**: Compliance architecture, data protection, and regulatory implementation
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in enterprise compliance and regulatory architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [ ] PCI DSS compliance strategy for payment processing documented
- [ ] GDPR compliance strategy for data privacy documented
- [ ] Regional compliance requirements (CCPA, LGPD, etc.) analyzed
- [ ] Data residency and sovereignty requirements defined
- [ ] Audit and compliance monitoring strategies documented
- [ ] Compliance automation and tooling strategies defined
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies documented

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of compliance requirements and regulatory frameworks
- **Evaluation**: Implementation complexity, cost, and operational impact
- **Pattern Analysis**: Compliance patterns, data protection, and audit strategies
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Compliance framework review and expert consultation

## Architecture Considerations
- **Payment Security**: PCI DSS Level 1 compliance for payment processing
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for EU user data handling
- **Regional Compliance**: CCPA (California), LGPD (Brazil), and other regional requirements
- **Data Residency**: Keep data within required geographic boundaries
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring for compliance audits

## Implementation Steps
1. Research PCI DSS requirements and implementation strategies
2. Analyze GDPR requirements and data protection approaches
3. Evaluate regional compliance requirements (CCPA, LGPD, etc.)
4. Define data residency and sovereignty strategies
5. Document audit and compliance monitoring approaches
6. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. Define compliance automation and tooling strategies
8. Document risk assessment and mitigation approaches

## Learning Objectives
- PCI DSS compliance and payment security requirements
- GDPR compliance and data protection strategies
- Regional compliance requirements and implementation
- Data residency and sovereignty patterns
- Compliance automation and audit strategies
