# [TASK-004] Create ADR for Data Storage & Consistency Patterns

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 4 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Started**: 
**Completed**: 

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for data storage technologies and consistency patterns. This decision will establish how data is stored, replicated, and maintained across the distributed e-commerce platform, including the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Deep understanding of distributed data management and CAP theorem trade-offs
- **Foundation**: Establishes data architecture that affects all business operations
- **Architecture Skills**: Data modeling for distributed systems and consistency patterns
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in complex data architecture decisions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [ ] PostgreSQL vs alternatives (MySQL, CockroachDB) analysis completed
- [ ] Redis vs alternatives (Memcached, Hazelcast) analysis completed
- [ ] ClickHouse vs alternatives (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) analysis completed
- [ ] Event sourcing + CQRS pattern analysis completed
- [ ] CAP theorem trade-offs documented for each data type
- [ ] Data partitioning and sharding strategies defined
- [ ] Backup, recovery, and disaster recovery strategies documented

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of database technologies and patterns
- **Evaluation**: Consistency model trade-offs and performance characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Event sourcing, CQRS, and saga pattern implementation
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Performance testing and consistency validation

## Architecture Considerations
- **Consistency Requirements**: Order data (CP) vs Product catalog (AP) vs User sessions (P)
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms response times for product searches
- **Scalability**: Handle large datasets with efficient partitioning
- **Reliability**: Data durability and recovery requirements
- **Operational Complexity**: Database administration and monitoring overhead

## Implementation Steps
1. Research relational database options (PostgreSQL, MySQL, CockroachDB)
2. Evaluate caching solutions (Redis, Memcached, Hazelcast)
3. Analyze analytics database options (ClickHouse, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
4. Research event sourcing and CQRS patterns
5. Define consistency requirements for each data domain
6. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. Document data partitioning and sharding strategies
8. Define backup and recovery procedures

## Learning Objectives
- Distributed database design and consistency models
- CAP theorem trade-offs and practical implications
- Event sourcing and CQRS pattern implementation
- Data partitioning and sharding strategies
- Database performance optimization for distributed systems
