# [TASK-001] Setup Basic Microservice Architecture

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2 days
**Type**: Infrastructure
**Created**: 2024-01-15
**Started**: 
**Completed**: 

## Description
Set up the foundational microservice architecture with Docker containers, basic API gateway, and service discovery for the distributed systems learning project. This will serve as the foundation for all subsequent microservices.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Establishes core distributed systems concepts and patterns
- **Foundation**: Creates reusable architecture for future microservices
- **Skill Development**: Hands-on experience with containerization and service orchestration
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates understanding of microservice architecture patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Docker Compose setup with at least 2 microservices
- [ ] API Gateway configured to route requests
- [ ] Service discovery mechanism implemented
- [ ] Basic health check endpoints for all services
- [ ] Services can communicate with each other
- [ ] Documentation for running the system locally

## Technical Approach
- **Containerization**: Docker with Docker Compose for local development
- **API Gateway**: NGINX or Traefik for request routing
- **Service Discovery**: Consul or simple DNS-based discovery
- **Languages**: Node.js/Express for simplicity, or Go for performance
- **Services**: 
  - User Service (authentication, user management)
  - Product Service (catalog, inventory)
  - API Gateway

## Architecture Overview
```
[Client] → [API Gateway] → [User Service]
                        → [Product Service]
                        → [Service Discovery]
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Create Docker Compose configuration
2. Implement basic User Service with health endpoint
3. Implement basic Product Service with health endpoint
4. Configure API Gateway routing
5. Add service discovery mechanism
6. Test inter-service communication
7. Document setup and usage

- [Consul Service Discovery](https://www.consul.io/docs/discovery)

## Progress Log
<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Completion Notes
<!-- Add notes upon completion -->

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Docker/containerization learning curve - *Mitigation: Start with simple services*
- **Integration Risk**: Service discovery complexity - *Mitigation: Use well-documented tools like Consul*
- **Time Risk**: Scope creep with additional features - *Mitigation: Stick to MVP acceptance criteria*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code written and follows best practices
- [ ] All services run via Docker Compose
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions
- [ ] Basic integration tests verify service communication
- [ ] Health checks working for all services
- [ ] Can demonstrate end-to-end request flow
- [ ] Code committed to version control

## Follow-up Tasks
- TASK-002: Implement distributed logging
- TASK-003: Add monitoring and metrics
- TASK-004: Implement circuit breaker pattern
