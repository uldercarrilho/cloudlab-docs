# [TASK-009] Create ADR for Security & Authentication

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Started**: 
**Completed**: 

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for security and authentication strategies. This decision will establish the authentication mechanisms, authorization models, encryption standards, and security patterns for the distributed e-commerce platform, ensuring compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR requirements.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding security patterns and authentication strategies in distributed systems
- **Foundation**: Establishes security backbone for all business operations
- **Architecture Skills**: Security design, compliance requirements, and threat modeling
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in enterprise-grade security architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [ ] OAuth2 + JWT vs alternatives analysis completed
- [ ] RBAC vs alternatives (ABAC, PBAC) analysis completed
- [ ] HashiCorp Vault vs alternatives analysis completed
- [ ] Encryption standards (TLS 1.3, AES-256) documented
- [ ] Multi-tenant security isolation strategy defined
- [ ] Rate limiting and API security patterns documented
- [ ] Compliance requirements (PCI DSS, GDPR) documented

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of security and authentication technologies
- **Evaluation**: Security, performance, and compliance characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Security patterns, threat modeling, and compliance strategies
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Security testing and compliance validation

## Architecture Considerations
- **Multi-tenant Security**: Complete isolation between tenants
- **Payment Security**: PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for user data handling
- **Performance**: Security overhead impact on response times
- **Operational Complexity**: Key management and security monitoring

## Implementation Steps
1. Research authentication mechanisms (OAuth2, SAML, OpenID Connect)
2. Analyze authorization models (RBAC, ABAC, PBAC)
3. Evaluate secret management solutions (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
4. Define encryption standards and key management strategies
5. Document multi-tenant security isolation patterns
6. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. Define compliance requirements and validation strategies
8. Document threat modeling and security testing approaches

## Learning Objectives
- Security patterns and best practices in distributed systems
- Authentication and authorization model design
- Compliance requirements and implementation strategies
- Threat modeling and security testing
- Multi-tenant security architecture

## Resources

- Knowledge of compliance requirements
- Access to security testing tools and environments

## Progress Log
<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Risk Assessment
- **Security Risk**: Vulnerabilities in authentication - *Mitigation: Thorough security testing*
- **Compliance Risk**: Regulatory non-compliance - *Mitigation: Expert review and validation*
- **Complexity Risk**: Security implementation complexity - *Mitigation: Start with proven patterns*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ADR document completed and reviewed
- [ ] Decision matrix with all alternatives documented
- [ ] Security architecture defined with rationale
- [ ] Compliance requirements documented
- [ ] Threat modeling completed
- [ ] Security testing strategy defined

## Follow-up Tasks
- TASK-010: Create ADR for CI/CD & Deployment
- TASK-011: Create ADR for Performance & Caching
- TASK-012: Implement security proof of concept
