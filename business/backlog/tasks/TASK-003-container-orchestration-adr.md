# [TASK-003] Create ADR for Container Orchestration & Service Mesh

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Started**: 
**Completed**: 

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for the container orchestration platform and service mesh technology choices. This decision will establish the foundation for how services are deployed, managed, and communicate with each other in the distributed e-commerce platform.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding container orchestration trade-offs and service mesh patterns
- **Foundation**: Establishes core infrastructure decisions that affect all future development
- **Architecture Skills**: Deep dive into distributed systems infrastructure patterns
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates ability to make and document critical architectural decisions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [ ] Kubernetes vs alternatives (Docker Swarm, Nomad) analysis completed
- [ ] Istio vs alternatives (Linkerd, Consul Connect) analysis completed
- [ ] Multi-cluster strategy documented with rationale
- [ ] Resource requirements and scaling considerations documented
- [ ] Migration path and rollback strategy defined
- [ ] Team skills assessment and training plan included

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of container orchestration platforms
- **Evaluation**: Service mesh technologies comparison
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Proof of concept for selected technologies
- **Planning**: Implementation roadmap and risk mitigation

## Architecture Considerations
- **Scalability**: Handle 10x traffic spikes during sales events
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime requirement
- **Security**: Multi-tenant isolation and service-to-service security
- **Operational Complexity**: Team learning curve and operational overhead
- **Cost**: Infrastructure and operational costs

## Implementation Steps
1. Research container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Nomad)
2. Evaluate service mesh technologies (Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect)
3. Analyze multi-cluster strategies and isolation patterns
4. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
5. Document final decision with rationale
6. Create implementation roadmap
7. Define success metrics and validation criteria

## Learning Objectives
- Container orchestration platform trade-offs and considerations
- Service mesh patterns and implementation strategies
- Multi-cluster architecture design and management
- Infrastructure decision-making frameworks
- ADR documentation best practices

## Resources
- [ADR Template](architecture/adrs/)
- [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)
- [Istio Service Mesh](https://istio.io/docs/)
- [Container Orchestration Comparison](https://www.g2.com/categories/container-orchestration)
- [Service Mesh Comparison](https://servicemesh.es/)

## Dependencies
- Understanding of microservice architecture patterns
- Basic knowledge of containerization concepts
- Access to infrastructure for proof of concept testing

## Progress Log
<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Risk Assessment
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Too many options to evaluate - *Mitigation: Focus on top 3 alternatives*
- **Technology Lock-in**: Early commitment to complex platform - *Mitigation: Start with managed services*
- **Team Skills Gap**: Learning curve for chosen technologies - *Mitigation: Include training plan in ADR*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ADR document completed and reviewed
- [ ] Decision matrix with all alternatives documented
- [ ] Implementation roadmap created
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies documented
- [ ] Team training requirements identified
- [ ] Success metrics and validation criteria defined

## Follow-up Tasks
- TASK-004: Create ADR for Data Storage & Consistency
- TASK-005: Create ADR for Message Queue & Event Streaming
- TASK-006: Implement proof of concept for chosen technologies
