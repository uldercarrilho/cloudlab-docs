# [TASK-005] Create ADR for Message Queue & Event Streaming

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Started**: 
**Completed**: 

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for message queue and event streaming technologies. This decision will establish how services communicate asynchronously, handle real-time events, and implement event-driven architecture patterns across the distributed e-commerce platform.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding event-driven architecture and asynchronous communication patterns
- **Foundation**: Establishes communication backbone for all service interactions
- **Architecture Skills**: Event sourcing, saga patterns, and message passing strategies
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in distributed messaging and event streaming

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [ ] Apache Kafka vs alternatives (RabbitMQ, Apache Pulsar, AWS SQS/SNS) analysis completed
- [ ] Event-driven architecture pattern analysis completed
- [ ] Message ordering and delivery guarantees documented
- [ ] Saga pattern implementation strategy defined
- [ ] Event schema design and versioning strategy documented
- [ ] Performance and scalability requirements defined
- [ ] Dead letter queue and error handling strategies documented

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of message queue and event streaming technologies
- **Evaluation**: Performance, reliability, and operational characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Event-driven architecture, saga patterns, and CQRS integration
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Throughput and latency testing

## Architecture Considerations
- **Real-time Requirements**: Inventory updates, notifications, and analytics
- **Reliability**: Message delivery guarantees and failure handling
- **Scalability**: Handle 10x traffic spikes during sales events
- **Ordering**: Event ordering requirements for business processes
- **Operational Complexity**: Monitoring, debugging, and maintenance overhead

## Implementation Steps
1. Research message queue technologies (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pulsar, AWS SQS/SNS)
2. Analyze event-driven architecture patterns and benefits
3. Evaluate saga pattern implementation strategies
4. Define event schema design and versioning approach
5. Document message ordering and delivery guarantees
6. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. Define monitoring and observability requirements
8. Document error handling and dead letter queue strategies

## Learning Objectives
- Event-driven architecture patterns and implementation
- Message queue technology trade-offs and selection criteria
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Event schema design and versioning strategies
- Asynchronous communication in distributed systems

## Resources
- [ADR Template](architecture/adrs/)
- [Apache Kafka Documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)
- [RabbitMQ Documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html)
- [Event-Driven Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html)
- [Saga Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html)
- [Message Queue Comparison](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-Apache-Kafka-and-RabbitMQ)

## Dependencies
- Understanding of asynchronous communication patterns
- Knowledge of distributed systems messaging concepts
- Access to infrastructure for performance testing

## Progress Log
<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Risk Assessment
- **Complexity Risk**: Event-driven architecture learning curve - *Mitigation: Start with simple patterns*
- **Performance Risk**: Message queue bottlenecks - *Mitigation: Thorough performance testing*
- **Operational Risk**: Complex debugging and monitoring - *Mitigation: Comprehensive observability*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ADR document completed and reviewed
- [ ] Decision matrix with all alternatives documented
- [ ] Event-driven architecture patterns defined
- [ ] Message ordering and delivery guarantees documented
- [ ] Saga pattern implementation strategy defined
- [ ] Performance requirements and benchmarks established

## Follow-up Tasks
- TASK-006: Create ADR for API & Communication Patterns
- TASK-007: Create ADR for Cloud & Infrastructure
- TASK-008: Implement message queue proof of concept
