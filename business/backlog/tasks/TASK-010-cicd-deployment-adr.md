# [TASK-010] Create ADR for CI/CD & Deployment

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days
**Type**: Research/Infrastructure
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Started**: 
**Completed**: 

## Description
Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for CI/CD platforms and deployment strategies. This decision will establish the continuous integration, deployment automation, and advanced deployment patterns for the distributed e-commerce platform, ensuring zero-downtime deployments and operational excellence.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Understanding CI/CD patterns and deployment automation in distributed systems
- **Foundation**: Establishes deployment pipeline that affects development velocity
- **Architecture Skills**: Deployment automation, feature flags, and rollback strategies
- **Portfolio**: Demonstrates expertise in modern DevOps practices and deployment automation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ADR document created following standard ADR format
- [ ] GitLab CI vs GitHub Actions vs alternatives analysis completed
- [ ] Blue-Green vs Canary vs Rolling deployment analysis completed
- [ ] Feature flag service selection (LaunchDarkly vs alternatives) completed
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code deployment strategy documented
- [ ] Rollback and disaster recovery strategies defined
- [ ] Testing and validation strategies documented
- [ ] Multi-environment deployment strategy defined

## Technical Approach
- **Research**: Comprehensive analysis of CI/CD platforms and deployment strategies
- **Evaluation**: Performance, cost, and operational characteristics
- **Pattern Analysis**: Deployment patterns, automation strategies, and rollback mechanisms
- **Documentation**: Standard ADR format with decision matrix
- **Validation**: Deployment testing and automation validation

## Architecture Considerations
- **Zero-downtime**: 99.9% uptime requirement during deployments
- **Automation**: Reduce manual deployment errors and increase velocity
- **Rollback**: Fast recovery from failed deployments
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before production deployment
- **Operational Complexity**: Team skills and maintenance overhead

## Implementation Steps
1. Research CI/CD platforms (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI)
2. Analyze deployment strategies (Blue-Green, Canary, Rolling, A/B Testing)
3. Evaluate feature flag services (LaunchDarkly, Flagsmith, Unleash)
4. Define Infrastructure as Code deployment patterns
5. Document rollback and disaster recovery strategies
6. Create decision matrix with weighted criteria
7. Define testing and validation requirements
8. Document multi-environment deployment strategy

## Learning Objectives
- CI/CD pipeline design and automation
- Deployment strategies and rollback mechanisms
- Feature flag implementation and management
- Infrastructure as Code deployment patterns
- DevOps practices and operational excellence

## Resources
- [ADR Template](architecture/adrs/)
- [GitLab CI Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- [Blue-Green Deployment](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html)
- [Canary Deployment](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html)
- [Feature Flags](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html)

## Dependencies
- Understanding of CI/CD concepts and practices
- Knowledge of deployment automation and testing
- Access to CI/CD platforms for testing and evaluation

## Progress Log
<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Risk Assessment
- **Deployment Risk**: Failed deployments affecting production - *Mitigation: Comprehensive testing and rollback*
- **Complexity Risk**: Over-automation complexity - *Mitigation: Start with simple patterns*
- **Operational Risk**: CI/CD pipeline maintenance - *Mitigation: Use managed services where possible*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ADR document completed and reviewed
- [ ] Decision matrix with all alternatives documented
- [ ] CI/CD platform selected with rationale
- [ ] Deployment strategies defined
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms documented
- [ ] Testing and validation strategy established

## Follow-up Tasks
- TASK-011: Create ADR for Performance & Caching
- TASK-012: Create ADR for Search & Analytics
- TASK-013: Implement CI/CD proof of concept
