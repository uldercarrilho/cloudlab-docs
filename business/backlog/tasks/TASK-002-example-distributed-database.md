# [TASK-002] Implement Distributed Database Pattern

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 3 days
**Type**: Infrastructure
**Created**: 2024-01-15
**Started**: 
**Completed**: 

## Description
Implement a distributed database pattern with database-per-service approach, including data synchronization and consistency mechanisms. This task focuses on learning distributed data management patterns in microservices architecture.

## Business Value
- **Learning Value**: Deep understanding of distributed data patterns and CAP theorem
- **Practical Experience**: Hands-on implementation of eventual consistency patterns
- **Architecture Skills**: Experience with event-driven architecture and message queues
- **Problem Solving**: Understanding trade-offs in distributed data management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each microservice has its own database instance
- [ ] Database containerization with Docker
- [ ] Data synchronization mechanism between services
- [ ] Implementation of eventual consistency pattern
- [ ] Database migration scripts and versioning
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations for each service
- [ ] Data integrity validation across services

## Technical Approach
- **Database per Service**: PostgreSQL instances for each microservice
- **Synchronization**: Event-driven architecture with message queues
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency with compensation patterns
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Migration**: Flyway or similar for database versioning

## Database Design
```
User Service DB:
- users table (id, email, password_hash, created_at)
- user_profiles table (user_id, name, preferences)

Product Service DB:
- products table (id, name, description, price, created_at)
- inventory table (product_id, quantity, reserved)

Event Store:
- events table (id, aggregate_id, event_type, payload, timestamp)
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up PostgreSQL containers for each service
2. Create database schemas and migration scripts
3. Implement basic CRUD operations in each service
4. Set up message queue (RabbitMQ)
5. Implement event publishing for data changes
6. Create event handlers for cross-service data sync
7. Test data consistency scenarios
8. Implement compensation patterns for failures
9. Add database health checks and monitoring

## Learning Objectives
- Database per service pattern
- Eventual consistency in distributed systems
- Event-driven architecture
- Data synchronization strategies
- Transaction management across services
- CAP theorem practical implications

## Dependencies
- TASK-001: Basic microservice architecture must be completed
- Docker and Docker Compose setup

## Progress Log
<!-- Update as work progresses -->

## Completion Notes
<!-- Add notes upon completion -->

## Risk Assessment
- **Complexity Risk**: Event-driven architecture can be complex - *Mitigation: Start with simple events*
- **Data Consistency Risk**: Eventual consistency can be confusing - *Mitigation: Design clear compensation patterns*
- **Performance Risk**: Message queue overhead - *Mitigation: Benchmark and optimize*
- **Learning Risk**: Multiple new concepts at once - *Mitigation: Break into smaller steps*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All database containers running and accessible
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations working in each service
- [ ] Event publishing implemented for data changes
- [ ] Event handlers processing cross-service updates
- [ ] Data consistency verified through test scenarios
- [ ] Compensation patterns implemented for failures
- [ ] Documentation covers architecture and patterns
- [ ] Performance benchmarks recorded
- [ ] Code committed with comprehensive tests

## Follow-up Tasks
- TASK-003: Implement distributed caching
- TASK-004: Add database backup and recovery
- TASK-005: Implement read replicas for scaling
