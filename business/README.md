  - `tasks/` – Individual detailed task files ready for work
  - `active/` – Current work tracking (ready, in-progress, blocked)
  - `archived/` – Completed and cancelled task files for reference
  - `templates/` – Task and bug templates for consistency

### 📋 Requirements Management
- **`requirements/functional/`** – Functional requirements and specifications
- **`requirements/non-functional/`** – Performance, security, and quality requirements

### 👥 User-Centered Design
- **`user-stories/`** – User stories and epics that drive development
- **`user-stories/epics/`** – Large-scale initiatives and feature themes

### 🔄 Business Processes

- **`compliance/`** – Compliance requirements and documentation

## 🎯 Key Features

### AI-Assisted Backlog Management
The backlog management system is specifically designed for AI agents to:
- **Parse and execute tasks** using structured templates
- **Track progress** through defined workflow states
- **Manage dependencies** and blockers automatically
- **Generate reports** on velocity and completion metrics
- **Maintain historical records** for learning and improvement

### Structured Task Lifecycle (Solo Development)

```

### Template-Driven Consistency
- **Task Template**: Standard structure for distributed systems learning tasks
- **Task Template (Simplified)**: Streamlined version matching actual usage
- **Bug Template**: Issue reporting and tracking

## 🚀 Getting Started (Solo Development)

### Basic Workflow
1. **Capture ideas** in `backlog/TODO.md`
2. **Create detailed task** in `backlog/tasks/TASK-XXX-description.md`
3. **Add to ready queue** in `backlog/active/ready.md`
4. **Start work** and move to `backlog/active/in-progress.md`
5. **Track progress** in individual task file
6. **Complete** and move task file to `backlog/archived/completed/`

### For Distributed Systems Learning
1. **Focus on one task** at a time for deep learning
2. **Document learnings** and decisions in task files
3. **Build incrementally** from simple to complex systems
4. **Reference completed tasks** for future implementations
5. **Track skill progression** through archived work

### For AI Agent Assistance
1. **Use structured templates** for consistent task creation
2. **Maintain clear acceptance criteria** for automated validation
3. **Update progress regularly** for accurate tracking
4. **Document outcomes** for learning and reference

## 📊 Learning Progress Metrics

The system tracks key metrics for solo development:
- **Task Completion**: Tasks completed per week/month
- **Learning Velocity**: New distributed systems concepts mastered
- **Implementation Quality**: Successful deployments and functionality
- **Knowledge Retention**: Ability to reference and reuse past work
- **Skill Progression**: Complexity of tasks completed over time
