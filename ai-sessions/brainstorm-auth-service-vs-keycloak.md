## üîç Problem Analysis Phase

### **1. Problem Statement**

**Current Situation:**
CloudLab is a distributed e-commerce platform designed as a learning environment for distributed systems patterns. The project currently has ADR-001 and ADR-009 that specify implementing a custom OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect provider using Go, but we need to evaluate if using Keycloak would be more appropriate given the project's learning objectives and constraints.

**Desired Outcome:**
Choose the authentication approach that best balances learning value, implementation complexity, and alignment with the project's distributed systems education goals.

**Pain Points:**
- [ ] Custom auth implementation may be overly complex for learning objectives
- [ ] Keycloak might abstract away important distributed systems concepts
- [ ] Need to balance learning value with practical implementation
- [ ] Must maintain alignment with existing ADRs and business rules
- [ ] Solo development with AI assistance requires manageable complexity

### **2. Context Gathering**

**Questions to Explore:**
- [ ] What specific distributed systems concepts does authentication demonstrate?
- [ ] How does Keycloak integration affect microservices communication patterns?
- [ ] What's the learning value of implementing OAuth 2.0 from scratch vs integrating it?
- [ ] How does this decision impact the overall system architecture?
- [ ] What are the operational implications of each approach?

**Existing Systems/Constraints:**
- [ ] ADR-001: Specifies custom OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect implementation
- [ ] ADR-009: Defines security architecture with custom auth provider
- [ ] Business rules require multi-tenant user isolation
- [ ] Must support customers, vendors, admins, and support roles
- [ ] PCI DSS and GDPR compliance requirements
- [ ] Learning-first approach with mocked external services

## üéØ Synthesis & Decision Phase

### **7. Recommended Solution**

**Chosen Approach:** **Simplified Custom Auth Service (Learning-Focused)**

**Rationale:**
Based on the evaluation matrix and CloudLab's core objectives, the simplified custom auth approach provides the best balance of learning value and manageable complexity. This approach:

1. **Maximizes Learning Value**: Teaches OAuth 2.0 implementation, JWT management, microservices communication, and event-driven patterns
2. **Aligns with Project Goals**: Maintains the learning-first approach while being practical for solo development
3. **Manages Complexity**: Focuses on core distributed systems concepts without over-engineering
4. **Enables Custom Business Rules**: Supports the specific multi-tenant requirements and business logic
5. **Maintains Security**: Implements essential security patterns while being educational

**Key Benefits:**
- Demonstrates core distributed systems patterns (service communication, event sourcing, data consistency)
- Teaches security implementation concepts (password hashing, token management, session handling)
- Enables custom business rule implementation for multi-tenant architecture
- Maintains alignment with existing ADRs and business requirements
- Provides manageable complexity for AI-assisted development

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Security Risks**: Use proven libraries for crypto operations, implement comprehensive testing
- **Complexity Risks**: Focus on core features first, iterate based on learning objectives
- **Compliance Risks**: Implement essential compliance features, document security decisions
- **Maintenance Risks**: Create comprehensive documentation and automated testing

### **8. Hybrid Approach (if applicable)**

**Combined Solution:**
While the simplified custom auth is recommended, we should consider a phased approach:
1. **Phase 1**: Implement simplified custom auth with core OAuth 2.0 features
2. **Phase 2**: Add advanced security features as learning progresses
3. **Phase 3**: Consider Keycloak integration for production scenarios (if needed)

**Integration Strategy:**
- Start with basic OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect implementation
- Focus on microservices communication patterns
- Implement event-driven user management
- Add security features incrementally
- Document all decisions and learning outcomes
