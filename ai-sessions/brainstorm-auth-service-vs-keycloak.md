## üîç Problem Analysis Phase

### **1. Problem Statement**

**Current Situation:**
CloudLab is a distributed e-commerce platform designed as a learning environment for distributed systems patterns. The project currently has ADR-001 and ADR-009 that specify implementing a custom OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect provider using Go, but we need to evaluate if using Keycloak would be more appropriate given the project's learning objectives and constraints.

**Desired Outcome:**
Choose the authentication approach that best balances learning value, implementation complexity, and alignment with the project's distributed systems education goals.

**Pain Points:**
- [ ] Custom auth implementation may be overly complex for learning objectives
- [ ] Keycloak might abstract away important distributed systems concepts
- [ ] Need to balance learning value with practical implementation
- [ ] Must maintain alignment with existing ADRs and business rules
- [ ] Solo development with AI assistance requires manageable complexity

### **2. Context Gathering**

**Questions to Explore:**
- [ ] What specific distributed systems concepts does authentication demonstrate?
- [ ] How does Keycloak integration affect microservices communication patterns?
- [ ] What's the learning value of implementing OAuth 2.0 from scratch vs integrating it?
- [ ] How does this decision impact the overall system architecture?
- [ ] What are the operational implications of each approach?

**Existing Systems/Constraints:**
- [ ] ADR-001: Specifies custom OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect implementation
- [ ] ADR-009: Defines security architecture with custom auth provider
- [ ] Business rules require multi-tenant user isolation
- [ ] Must support customers, vendors, admins, and support roles
- [ ] PCI DSS and GDPR compliance requirements
- [ ] Learning-first approach with mocked external services
