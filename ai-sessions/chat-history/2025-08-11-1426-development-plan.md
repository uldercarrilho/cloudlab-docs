Update the development plan as follow:
- use the current date instead of 2025-01-27
- I'll develop this system by myself with AI assistant, so it's not necessary include information about teams, target release, estimative, risk assessment, budget considerations, communication & stakeholders management, etc..
- when you use a acronym, include the full description for it.
- the backend service must be implemented in Golang.
- the code will be stored in GitHub, so CI/CD must be leverage on it
- I think might be important to define/refine the business rules for the whole system and for each service with its relation. Maybe it could be written in a separated document. Do do you suggest?

---

**Cursor**

I'll update the development plan to reflect your solo development approach with AI assistance, use the current date, clarify acronyms, specify Golang for backend services, and GitHub for CI/CD. I also agree that business rules should be in a separate document - let me update the plan and then create a business rules document.

**Approved By:** [Name, Title, Date]
```

Perfect! I've successfully updated both documents according to your requirements:

## 📋 **Updated Development Plan**
- ✅ **Current Date**: Updated to use current date instead of 2025-01-27
- ✅ **Solo Development**: Removed team composition, target release, and effort estimates
- ✅ **AI Assistance Focus**: Emphasized solo development with AI assistance
- ✅ **Acronym Clarification**: Added full descriptions for all acronyms (JWT, RBAC, CORS, TLS, AES, PCI DSS, GDPR, etc.)
- ✅ **Golang Backend**: Specified Go (Golang) for all backend services
- ✅ **GitHub CI/CD**: Updated to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ **Removed Sections**: Eliminated team management, budget considerations, stakeholder communication, and risk assessment sections
- ✅ **Technical Focus**: Added specific Go technology stack details and architecture decisions

## 📋 **New Business Rules Document**
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Detailed business rules for all services and their interactions
- ✅ **Service Relationships**: Clear definition of how services communicate and share data
- ✅ **Business Logic**: Specific rules for order processing, payment, inventory, etc.
- ✅ **Compliance**: GDPR, PCI DSS, and regulatory requirements
- ✅ **Validation**: Business rule testing and monitoring strategies

## 🎯 **Key Benefits of This Approach**

### **For Development:**
1. **Clear Business Logic**: The business rules document provides explicit rules that can be directly implemented in Go code
2. **Service Boundaries**: Well-defined relationships between services prevent integration issues
3. **Compliance Ready**: Built-in regulatory compliance from the start

### **For AI Assistance:**
1. **Specific Requirements**: AI can generate Go code that directly implements these business rules
2. **Validation Logic**: Clear validation criteria for testing and quality assurance
3. **Integration Patterns**: Defined service communication patterns for distributed system design

### **For Solo Development:**
1. **Focused Scope**: Removed unnecessary team coordination overhead
2. **Clear Milestones**: Phased approach with specific deliverables for each phase
3. **AI Acceleration**: Structured approach that maximizes AI assistance effectiveness

## �� **Next Steps**

1. **Review Documents**: Both documents are ready for your review and approval
2. **Phase 1 Initiation**: Begin with foundation and infrastructure setup
3. **AI Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate AI assistants for Go development and infrastructure
4. **Repository Setup**: Initialize GitHub repository with proper structure for the distributed system

The business rules document will be particularly valuable as you implement each service, ensuring that all business logic is consistently applied across the distributed system. Each service can reference these rules during development, and the AI assistant can help generate Go code that implements these rules correctly.

Would you like me to help you start implementing any specific phase or create additional supporting documents?
