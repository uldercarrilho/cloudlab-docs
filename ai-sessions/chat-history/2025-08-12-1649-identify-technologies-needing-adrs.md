**User**

Analyze the document @system-overview.md and list all technology, tool, or service that should have a ADR before we continue with our development process. Just pick on the most revelants. Don't make any change.

**Cursor**

I'll analyze the system overview document to identify the most relevant technologies, tools, and services that should have Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) before continuing with development.


Based on my analysis of the system overview document, here are the **most relevant technologies, tools, and services that should have ADRs before continuing with development**:

## **Critical Infrastructure & Platform Decisions**

### **1. Container Orchestration & Service Mesh**
- **Kubernetes** - Core orchestration platform choice
- **Istio** - Service mesh for secure inter-service communication
- **Multi-cluster strategy** - Critical vs non-critical path isolation

### **2. Data Storage & Consistency**
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary relational database choice
- **Redis Cluster** - Distributed caching strategy
- **ClickHouse** - Analytics database choice
- **Elasticsearch** - Search engine choice
- **Event sourcing + CQRS** - Data architecture patterns

### **3. Message Queue & Event Streaming**
- **Apache Kafka** - Event streaming platform choice
- **Event-driven architecture** - Communication pattern decision

### **4. API & Communication Patterns**
- **GraphQL** - API query language choice
- **gRPC** - Internal service communication protocol
- **REST APIs** - External API design pattern
- **WebSocket** - Real-time communication choice

## **High-Impact Technology Choices**

### **5. Cloud & Infrastructure**
- **AWS** - Cloud provider choice (Route53, S3, CloudFront, ALB)
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as Code tool choice
- **Multi-region deployment** - Geographic distribution strategy

### **6. Monitoring & Observability**
- **Prometheus + Grafana** - Metrics and visualization stack
- **ELK Stack** - Logging solution choice
- **Jaeger** - Distributed tracing choice
- **New Relic/Datadog** - APM tool choice

### **7. Security & Authentication**
- **OAuth2 + JWT** - Authentication strategy
- **HashiCorp Vault** - Secret management choice
- **RBAC** - Authorization model choice

### **8. CI/CD & Deployment**
- **GitLab CI/GitHub Actions** - CI/CD platform choice
- **Docker** - Containerization strategy
- **Blue-Green/Canary** - Deployment strategy choice
- **Feature flags** - Runtime configuration strategy

## **Why These Need ADRs**

These technologies represent **foundational decisions** that will:
- **Lock in** the architecture for years
- **Significantly impact** development velocity and operational complexity
- **Affect** team skills and hiring requirements
- **Determine** scalability and reliability characteristics
- **Influence** cost structure and vendor relationships

## **Lower Priority (Can Be Decided Later)**
- Specific load balancer choice (HAProxy vs AWS ALB)
- CDN provider choice (CloudFlare vs others)
- Specific APM tool (New Relic vs Datadog)
- Feature flag service (LaunchDarkly vs alternatives)

The ADRs for the critical technologies should be created **before** any significant development begins, as changing these decisions later would require substantial refactoring and could delay the project significantly.

Use the backlog management in this repository to create a task for each one listed before. The goal of each task is to create an ADR document. Don't execute the tasks now, just create them.

**Cursor**

I'll create tasks for each of the critical technologies that need ADRs. Let me first examine the backlog structure and templates to understand the proper format.


Now I'll create tasks for each of the critical technologies that need ADRs. I'll use the simplified task template and create them in the tasks directory.
