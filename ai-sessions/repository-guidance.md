## üéØ Repository Selection Guidelines for AI Agents

### When Working on Features:
1. **User-facing features** ‚Üí `web` (customer interface) or `admin` (administrative interface)
2. **Business logic and APIs** ‚Üí `platform` (core services and microservices)
3. **Infrastructure changes** ‚Üí `infrastructure` (Terraform, Kubernetes, monitoring)
4. **Documentation updates** ‚Üí `docs` (ADRs, guides, specifications)

### When Troubleshooting:
1. **UI/UX issues** ‚Üí `web` or `admin`
2. **API or service issues** ‚Üí `platform` 
3. **Deployment or infrastructure issues** ‚Üí `infrastructure`
4. **Need architectural context** ‚Üí `docs` (check ADRs and system overview)

### When Planning Architecture:
1. **Start with** ‚Üí `docs` (review existing ADRs and system overview)
2. **Document decisions** ‚Üí `docs` (create new ADRs)
3. **Implement infrastructure** ‚Üí `infrastructure` (Terraform/K8s changes)
4. **Build services** ‚Üí `platform` (microservices implementation)
5. **Create interfaces** ‚Üí `web`/`admin` (user-facing components)

## üîß Development Workflow Guidance

### Standard Development Flow:
1. **Research** ‚Üí Review `docs` for existing patterns and decisions
2. **Plan** ‚Üí Create or update ADRs in `docs` for architectural decisions
3. **Infrastructure** ‚Üí Update `infrastructure` for resource requirements
4. **Backend** ‚Üí Implement in `platform` for business logic and APIs
5. **Frontend** ‚Üí Build interfaces in `web` (customer) or `admin` (administrative)
6. **Document** ‚Üí Update `docs` with implementation details and runbooks

### Repository Dependencies:
- `web` and `admin` depend on `platform` APIs
- `platform` services depend on `infrastructure` resources
- All repositories should reference `docs` for architectural guidance
- `docs` should be updated to reflect changes in other repositories
