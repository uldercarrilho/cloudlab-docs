# AI Agent Task Template Creation Prompt

## üéØ Objective
Create a comprehensive, AI agent-optimized task template that enables effective task creation, execution, and tracking for distributed systems development projects.

## üìã Context
You are designing a task template specifically for AI agents to create, manage, and execute tasks in a distributed systems learning project. The template should be:

- **AI-friendly**: Structured for optimal AI agent comprehension and execution
- **Distributed systems focused**: Emphasizing architectural thinking and system design
- **Actionable**: Clear, specific, and executable by AI agents
- **Traceable**: Enables progress tracking and learning documentation
- **Scalable**: Adaptable to different task types and complexity levels

## üîç Analysis Requirements

### 1. Template Structure Analysis
Analyze the existing task templates in the project:
- `backlog/templates/task-template.md` (comprehensive)
- `backlog/templates/task-template-simplified.md` (streamlined)

Identify:
- Essential sections that must be included
- Sections that can be optimized for AI agents
- Missing elements that would benefit AI agent execution
- Redundant or overly complex sections

### 2. AI Agent Optimization Requirements
Consider how AI agents work and what they need:
- **Clear input/output expectations**: What the agent receives and must produce
- **Structured decision points**: Where the agent needs to make choices
- **Validation criteria**: How the agent knows it's on the right track
- **Error handling guidance**: What to do when things go wrong
- **Progress tracking**: How to document incremental progress
- **Learning integration**: How to capture insights and decisions

### 3. Distributed Systems Focus
Ensure the template emphasizes:
- **Architectural thinking**: System design and component relationships
- **Scalability considerations**: Performance and growth implications
- **Reliability patterns**: Fault tolerance and error handling
- **Integration complexity**: Service communication and data flow
- **Trade-off analysis**: Performance vs. complexity vs. maintainability

## üé® Template Design Principles

### 1. AI Agent Workflow Optimization
- **Sequential execution**: Clear step-by-step progression
- **Decision trees**: Structured choices with consequences
- **Validation checkpoints**: Built-in quality gates
- **Feedback loops**: Opportunities for course correction
- **Documentation integration**: Automatic learning capture

### 2. Task Lifecycle Management
- **Creation phase**: Initial planning and scoping
- **Execution phase**: Implementation and testing
- **Validation phase**: Quality assurance and acceptance
- **Completion phase**: Documentation and handoff
- **Learning phase**: Reflection and improvement

### 3. Knowledge Management
- **Decision logging**: Why choices were made
- **Alternative exploration**: What was considered but not chosen
- **Learning outcomes**: New insights gained
- **Future considerations**: What to remember for next time
- **Reference materials**: Links to relevant resources
